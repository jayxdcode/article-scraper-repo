# article-scraper-repo

https://jayxdcode.github.io/article-scraper-repo/

A dual-implementation scraping toolkit featuring both **Node.js** and **Python** versions for extracting, structuring, and processing article content from various online platforms.

The **Node.js version is currently active and maintained**, while the **Python version is available but temporarily disabled**. Designed with modularity and flexibility in mind, this repository enables easy integration, selector customization, automated selector validation, and workflow-driven consistency checks.

*The plan is to integrate this as an API on other projects to automatically deliver specific article category to the user from many sources in one app. (Web and/or Android)*
