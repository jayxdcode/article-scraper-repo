# article-scraper-repo
A repository that automatically extracts [editorial] articles (for now) daily and saves it as 1) Markdown and 2) Docx.

The plan is to integrate this as an API on other projects to automatically deliver specific article category to the user from many sources in one app. (Web and/or Android)
