During the pandemic, health frontliners were hailed as heroes. For a long time, overseas Filipino workers have also been hailed as heroes, and rightfully so – although their massive remittances, which have kept the economy afloat even during global downturns, have been a disincentive to changing the rotten status quo that forced them to seek decent jobs overseas.

Today, National Heroes Day is celebrated amid widespread dismay over the extent of corruption related to flood control and other public works projects, as well as in the budget process, which affects all aspects of governance.

The revelations and investigations are just the start. Crime needs punishment, to deter a repeat and prevent impunity. But Filipinos know how tortuous the path can be from formal indictment to final conviction and punishment in this country. Tight cases must be built and material evidence presented to corroborate the testimonies of witnesses, who must not be harassed into retraction or, worse, murdered.

Malacañang has rolled out a website for reporting anomalies. With the tips that have deluged the site, anonymous reports will get swifter action if corroborated with documents, photos or related items.

There are reports that some contractors, notably the smaller operators, are considering testifying about corrupt practices, which they were forced to go along with for their businesses to survive. Some government personnel have also reportedly sent out feelers to serve as state witnesses.

Considering the amounts and personalities involved, it could be an act of heroism for people to come out and testify about wrongdoing in government, especially within their own agencies and involving their co-workers or superiors. Harassment and even deadly violence are genuine risks.

Looking the other way, however, will ensure that corruption will become even more entrenched and harder to uproot. A spark has been lit and the flame needs nurturing. This campaign cannot be just ningas cogon, a mere flash in the pan.

Providing tips on wrongdoing is already an act of heroism. Blowing the whistle in public, testifying and seeing it through until the crooks are punished are even greater heroic acts.

People can be heroes by saying no to graft.
