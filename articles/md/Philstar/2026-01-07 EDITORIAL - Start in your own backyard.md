It’s heartening to hear a member of the Supreme Court stressing the importance of fighting corruption. If SC justices could put their money where their mouth is, it would be a good start in a land that has gained notoriety for having the best justice that money can buy.

Addressing an anti-corruption forum recently, SC Senior Associate Justice Marvic Leonen said the judiciary is moving to fight corruption. He cited the introduction of new ethical standards for members of the bench as well as the provision of digital platforms and broader online access.

“Addressing corruption should be a clear, visible and urgent priority for all government workers. Corruption should no longer be hidden, shielded or perpetuated by excuses. When we hide corruption out of fear or guilt, we ensure an unjust society. We contradict the role that we should all play as agents of social justice,” Leonen said.

The SC, which supervises the judiciary, can start in its own backyard by easing the restrictions it imposed on the release of the statements of assets, liabilities and net worth of justices and judges. Former SC justice Samuel Martires expanded this SALN restriction to other government branches when he became ombudsman.

Martires’ successor Jesus Crispin Remulla has eased the restrictions, but his move does not cover the judiciary. The SALNs of President Marcos, Vice President Sara Duterte, her father former president Rodrigo Duterte and Martires have since been accessed by a party-list group and made public.

Several lawmakers have also released their SALNs, but no member of the SC has done so.

Leonen, who narrowly escaped impeachment in 2021 over issues related to his SALN, drew flak recently as the author or ponente of the SC ruling that used wrong information as one of the bases for invalidating the impeachment complaint filed by the House of Representatives against Vice President Duterte.

Critics of this SC ruling, currently under a motion for reconsideration, argue that it not only shielded Duterte from impeachment, but also effectively rewrote the Constitution and made it nearly impossible to impeach officials including justices of the Supreme Court. How does this promote transparency and accountability?

“It is our duty as those in positions of power to do our part and expand our influence, to stabilize the currently fragile institutions we hold,” Leonen told the anti-corruption forum. “Remaining silent in the face of all of this, especially when we have the duty to be the voice of our people, makes us complicit.”

Amen. Leonen should walk the talk and the SC should lead by example.
