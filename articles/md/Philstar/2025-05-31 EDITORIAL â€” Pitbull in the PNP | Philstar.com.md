Nicolas Torre III has made history. This is not only for leading the arrest of former president Rodrigo Duterte and sending him off to prison in The Hague, and for flushing out pastor Apollo Quiboloy from his Kingdom of Jesus Christ compound in Davao City.

Torre has become the first graduate of the Philippine National Police Academy to head the PNP, ending the dominance of Philippine Military Academy graduates in what is supposed to be a civilian police force.

Two PMA batches were skipped in the selection of Torre: Classes ’91 and ’92. Torre, a major general who has become eligible for four stars, belongs to the PNPA’s “Tagapaglunsad” Class of 1993.

Transition to the PNP from the former Philippine Constabulary-Integrated National Police allowed PMA graduates to join the police instead of the military services.

The constabulary had functions that bordered on law enforcement so the integration was not difficult. But questions were raised on the capability of officers with purely military training to carry out effective law enforcement and criminal investigation.

Despite such doubts, 30 graduates of the PMA led the PNP from its creation before Torre was appointed as national police chief. He must show the difference between civilian and military training in law enforcement, such as in carrying out science-based modern criminal investigation and in responding to peace and order concerns of communities.

Described as a “pitbull” by Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla, Torre is also expected to intensify the housecleaning in the PNP, to significantly reduce if not eliminate the propensity of police to take short cuts in law enforcement.

Remulla says there will be no extrajudicial killings in the name of law enforcement under the watch of Torre. Having led the operations to arrest Duterte, who is accused of crimes against humanity in his brutal crackdown on illegal drugs, Torre cannot afford to pursue that same bloody approach in dealing with the drug menace. And he must ensure that the PNP follows his lead. Law enforcement and human rights can and should go hand in hand.

Torre is assuming the PNP leadership amid concerns that peace and order is deteriorating, with ransom kidnapping back, a tourist murdered in Boracay and armed robberies being staged even in Bonifacio Global City. The pitbull must show that the law has teeth.
