With graft and corruption considered endemic across the country, agencies on the front line of the battle against this scourge must be manned by persons of utmost integrity and competence.

These agencies include the Commission on Audit, the Office of the Ombudsman as well as the Sandiganbayan anti-graft court.

President Marcos will soon be picking a new ombudsman to replace Samuel Martires, who retires at the end of the month. Malacañang said yesterday that the next ombudsman must be upright, courageous and fair, and that the President has not yet received the short list of nominees from the Judicial and Bar Council.

Malacañang has said the President supports accountability in public service. Whether this goes beyond platitudes may be inferred from the President’s choice for the next ombudsman. In previous administrations, the selection of the nation’s chief graft-buster has been linked to the need of the appointing power for protection from prosecution for corruption once the presidency is over.

The post of ombudsman, which evolved from the Office of the Tanodbayan that was created under the 1987 Constitution, has had controversial occupants. The first tanodbayan, Raul Gonzalez, was suspended indefinitely from law practice by the Supreme Court in 1989 for ignorance of the law. The suspension was lifted after four years.

In March 2011, Merceditas Gutierrez, who was appointed by Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, became the first ombudsman to be impeached. Gutierrez resigned two months later, just days before her impeachment trial was set to start.

Martires, an appointee of Rodrigo Duterte, has received flak for excluding the former president from plunder and corruption indictments related to the Pharmally Pharmaceuticals procurement scandal at the height of the COVID pandemic.

The outgoing ombudsman will also be remembered for keeping for the first time under lock and key the statements of assets and liabilities of government officials from the president down. The SALNs can indicate undue accumulation of wealth while holding public office. Advocates of transparency and accountability are hoping that this order will be lifted by the next ombudsman.

Martires also infamously proposed that those who comment on the SALN controversy be locked up for up to five years. His retirement at the end of the month should put an end to the policy of opaqueness that should have no place in theOffice of the Ombudsman.
