Manuel Bonoan has quit as secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways. But those who prepared its proposed spending program for 2026 are still in the DPWH and owe taxpayers an explanation. Bonoan himself has some explaining to do.

Sen. Panfilo Lacson and the chair of the Senate finance committee, Sherwin Gatchalian, went over the DPWH budget proposal with the help of experts in public works implementation, and came up with red flags.

These include vague or missing project specifications, splitting or phasing of projects, exactly the same costs for projects in different locations, and projects in the 2025 General Appropriations Act that have “reappeared” in the 2026 budget proposal.

Alerted to these questionable items, which lawmakers described as “insertions” in the National Expenditure Program, Department of Budget and Management Secretary Amenah Pangandaman explained that the DBM’s role together with the Development Budget Coordination Committee is merely to set a level for the DPWH funding under the NEP. The DBM and DBCC don’t have the expertise to vet each project proposed by the DPWH, Pangandaman said.

If not for the ever expanding scandal on flood control projects, the proposed 2026 budget for the DPWH – some 700 pages long of numbers-packed fine print – would have warranted merely a perfunctory glance from lawmakers.

This would be followed by a practice that has become the norm in recent years in Congress: a systematic mangling of the NEP, to accommodate pet projects earmarked by lawmakers, from the “small committee” of the House of Representatives, all the way to the bicameral conference where the big-ticket projects and funding are inserted.

By the time the bicam finishes the budget deliberations, the NEP would have been unrecognizable.

Now, thanks to the public outrage over large-scale corruption that has caused catastrophic flooding, the NEP is being subjected to minute scrutiny, particularly the part about the DPWH.

The public is waiting to find out who among the lawmakers made the insertions for flood control and other pet projects in this year’s GAA.

At the same time, the executive must identify the DPWH officials or employees who prepared its budget proposal for 2026. It’s not enough to delete the questionable items from the NEP. Those who tried to pull another fast one on taxpayers must be booted out of the DPWH and face appropriate charges.
