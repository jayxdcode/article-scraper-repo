Another official of the Department of Public Works and Highways is out of the scandal-plagued agency. DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon told the Senate Blue Ribbon committee yesterday that he had accepted the courtesy resignation of Maria Catalina Cabral as undersecretary for planning, public-private partnership and information management services.

The acceptance of the resignation was cited by Cabral for skipping the committee hearing yesterday. Blue Ribbon chair and Senate President Pro Tempore Panfilo Lacson had said Cabral had phoned a staff of Vicente Sotto III when the latter was not yet the Senate chief, suggesting that he make an insertion in the 2026 National Expenditure Program.

Cabral had also confirmed to the House committee on public works and highways that the first district of Davao City received P51 billion in infrastructure projects in the second half of the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte.

Dizon said Cabral had denied any impropriety. He advised her to issue the denial before lawmakers. Senators reportedly intend to subpoena Cabral, stressing that even if she is no longer with the DPWH, she can still be compelled to attend a congressional inquiry and be held accountable for any wrongdoing.

This is good to know, and must be applied in other cases, such as the ghost employee scandal in the Monetary Board, the highest policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.

Last month, a former councilor of Quezon City was sentenced to a cumulative prison term of over 100 years for 16 counts of graft, malversation and falsification of public documents over the payment of P361,500 in salaries, performance incentives and Christmas bonus to ghost employees in his office from June 2009 to June 2010. Dante de Guzman was also perpetually barred from public office and lost all his retirement and gratuity benefits.

On the other hand, it looks like V. Bruce Tolentino and Anita Linda Aquino are off the hook after resigning in June 2024 as Monetary Board members following the discovery of four ghost employees in their office payrolls. The BSP said it no longer had jurisdiction over resigned MB members, while Malaca√±ang said the matter would be up to the Office of the Ombudsman.

The BSP announced earlier this month that two MB supervisors had been formally dismissed. The supervisors, who were not named, reportedly lost their retirement benefits and civil service eligibility, and were barred from public office.

Against this backdrop, there are concerns that Cabral could also enjoy immunity from accountability following her resignation. If all DPWH officials and employees involved in the flood control scandal also resign irrevocably, perhaps they will also be beyond the reach of the law.
