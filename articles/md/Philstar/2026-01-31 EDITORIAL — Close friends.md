Bribery is a criminal offense that can warrant imprisonment of up to 12 years.

If fugitive gambling tycoon Charlie “Atong” Ang tried to bribe a government official through an intermediary, both that intermediary and Ang should have faced criminal indictment.

Rafael Calinisan has yet to explain why he did not do so. The executive officer of the National Police Commission had told reporters that through one of his “close friends,” Ang had offered him a bribe in July last year – long before Ang became a fugitive – to stop the Napolcom probe on police officers linked to the disappearance of at least 34 cockfighting aficionados.

Last Thursday, Calinisan disclosed that apart from Ang, a “local chief executive” who heads “a very tight group” also approached his “close friend” to offer a bribe. Calinisan did not identify the local executive, but said the bribe was offered supposedly a day after Ang did the same.

Calinisan claimed he was “insulted” by the alleged offers, both of which he said he turned down.

It’s fine to be insulted, but his story begs the question: why didn’t he go after those involved for attempted bribery, or perhaps obstruction of justice? Because the go-between is his close friend?

The charges leveled against Ang involve multiple kidnappings and possible murder. All the sabungeros remain missing. If whistleblower Julie “Dondon” Patidongan is telling the truth, the sabungeros were killed by the police suspects and the bodies buried in Taal Lake.

Shouldn’t a top official of a commission overseeing the Philippine National Police come down hard on anyone trying to influence the investigation of multiple cases of kidnapping and murder?

In the case of the “local chief executive,” apart from fines and imprisonment, offering a bribe could warrant perpetual disqualification from holding public office.

Calinisan’s story gives an indication of why Ang, now formally indicted and on the run, continues to evade arrest, despite a reward offer of P10 million for any information leading to his capture. The fugitive clearly has close friends in the right places.
