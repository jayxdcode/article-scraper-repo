Over the weekend, the 12 winners in the Senate race were officially proclaimed by the Commission on Elections. The results represented an eclectic mix that defied the surveys, with both the two biggest political camps sending less than half of their allies to the winning “Magic 12.”

Two traditional opposition stalwarts landed in the top five slots, ensuring a bigger minority in the upper chamber of the incoming 20th Congress.

At their proclamation, several of the winners profusely thanked their political patrons, raising concern about where the loyalties lie of those elected to serve the people.

Senators have a national constituency and they must serve that constituency rather than parochial interests. They must uphold the reputation of senators for independence from Malacañang, unlike members of the House of Representatives who can be made to bend to the will of the executive through the control of fund releases to local constituencies.

In addition to the many measures awaiting legislation in the incoming Congress, senators will be sitting as judges in the first-ever impeachment trial of the Vice President of the republic.

Emanating from the House, impeachment is largely a political exercise. But the trial at the Senate will have to be based on evidence, with the process adhering strictly to rules. The nation will be watching the trial closely to see that due process is followed and each senator’s vote will be based on solid evidence rather than purely partisan considerations.

Alongside the trial, the new Congress must also tackle the proposed national budget for 2026. The 2025 General Appropriations Act came under heavy fire and still faces legal challenges before the Supreme Court after the proposed National Expenditure Program was so thoroughly mangled for personal purposes by lawmakers that the NEP became unrecognizable.

Critics have described the budget mess as the institutionalization of the theft of people’s money through creative fund juggling. The controversy has been partly blamed for the failure of the administration slate to sweep the midterm elections particularly in the Senate race. House members, particularly the incoming new ones, must see the need for reforms in the budget process.

The administration has retained the majority in the House, but the alliances have become uncertain in the upper chamber. The Senate has long been seen as a chamber of independent republics, providing checks and balances not only to the executive but in many instances even to the excesses of the House.

The new set of senators must live up to this expectation of independence, always mindful of being sworn to serve the nation.
