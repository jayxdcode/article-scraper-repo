If it’s not red tape all the way down to the barangay level, demands for grease money from officials at all levels of government, or incoherent and redundant rules and regulations, political feuds and judicial action can drive away from the country even the most determined investor.

The latest casualty is the Makati City Subway Project. The contract was forged between the city government of Makati and a private consortium led by Philippine Infradev Holdings Inc.

It was supposed to be the first subway in the country, originally targeted to be up and running by this year, ahead of the full operation of the Metro Manila Subway. But last Friday, Infradev announced that it was shelving the project and bringing the case to the International Arbitration Center in Singapore.

Apart from delays caused by the COVID pandemic, the project has been derailed by the 2023 Supreme Court ruling declaring that what is now Bonifacio Global City as well as the enlisted men’s barrios or EMBOs are part of Taguig City instead of Makati. The ruling affected several subway stations and depots.

Planned way back in 2018, with a projected cost of $3.5 billion, the Makati subway was meant to have 10 underground stops spanning 10 kilometers within the city’s Central Business District and on to the Makati City Hall, Rockwell, University of Makati and Ospital ng Makati.

It was also designed to be an integrated transport network, with links to the Metro Rail Transit 3, the Pasig River ferry service and later to the Metro Manila subway.

Infradev auditor PwC places the consortium’s losses at P44 billion, including the cost of right-of-way acquisitions.

Taguig City officials have said they are not opposing the subway project. Infradev is also reportedly still hoping to salvage the project.

As thing currently stand, however, this has become the latest cautionary tale for those being invited to do business in the Philippines. The government must quickly go into damage control, before losing more investors to neighbors where doing business is much easier and predictable.
