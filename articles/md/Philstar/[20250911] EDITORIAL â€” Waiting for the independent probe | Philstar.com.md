Testifying at the Senate, contractor couple Curlee and Sarah Vizcaya identified several congressmen along with more officials of the Department of Public Works and Highways allegedly involved in corruption related to flood control projects.

Meanwhile, at the House of Representatives, sacked DPWH assistant district engineer Brice Hernandez accused Senators Jinggoy Estrada and Joel Villanueva of inserting a combined P955 million worth of flood control projects in Bulacan for funding in the national budget, and getting up to 30 percent of the project cost in kickbacks. Both senators have bristled at the accusation and issued heated denials.

Hernandez, currently detained in the Pasay City jail for contempt of the Senate, presented during his House testimony text messages and photos of mountains of cash supposedly paid as kickbacks.

Despite the denials all around, the scandal is confirming the worst suspicions long held by the public – that lawmakers and other politicians, in cahoots with DPWH officials, are at the heart of corruption in public works.

Testimonies of some of the principal players, even if self-serving and contradictory in many aspects, stress the urgency of getting the probe out of the hands of Congress and into a non-partisan and independent body.

Several senators and congressmen, including congressional leaders past and present, have been implicated by key players in this widening scandal. Whether or not the accusations are true, the credibility of the two chambers in handling the probe has been compromised.

Out of prudence and delicadeza, lawmakers must hand over the investigation to an independent probe body as soon as it is constituted. So President Marcos must organize the body as soon as possible, ensuring that it will have sufficient teeth not only to unearth the truth, but also to pave the way for bringing to justice those who stole billions of pesos in public funds.

Beyond exposés, the public expects punishment for this systematic and large-scale looting of the national coffers. After seeing all the shameless flaunting of questionable wealth, the government must show that crime does not pay. Failing to do so will guarantee impunity.
