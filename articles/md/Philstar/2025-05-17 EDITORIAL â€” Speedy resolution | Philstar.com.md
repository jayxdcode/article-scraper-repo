The 12 winners in the Senate race will be officially proclaimed today, to be followed shortly by the proclamation of the winning party-list groups and the number of seats allocated to them in the House of Representatives.

Nearly a week after the vote, however, complaints related to violations of campaign rules continue to be received by the Commission on Elections, with more expected in the coming days. As of yesterday morning, the Comelec had received 806 complaints of vote buying and selling related to the midterm elections.

Apart from violations of campaign rules, the Comelec is also expected to receive electoral protests. Depending on the positions at stake, such protests are settled either by the Comelec or the electoral tribunals.

Winning candidates found guilty of vote buying and other violations of election laws can be disqualified from their posts. Winners and losers alike can be permanently barred from public office if found guilty. Some election offenses warrant fines and imprisonment.

To serve as a deterrent, election complaints must be resolved ASAP. Candidates found by law and election rules to be unworthy of elective office must not be allowed to occupy the post.

In too many cases, however, slow adjudication of election protests and complaints of campaign violations allowed those eventually found guilty to occupy the contested positions, sometimes nearly finishing the term of office.

For the real winner, this is an irretrievable loss, and an injustice whose only redress is the belated punishment of the offender.

This situation has bred impunity in breaking election laws and rules. Seeing vote buyers, poll cheaters and blatant violators of fair campaign rules assuming public office guarantees a repeat of the offenses.

The Comelec has limited resources for speedy resolution, but perhaps it can tap civic groups for assistance in adjudicating electoral protests and complaints. It has enlisted civic groups in guarding the vote, battling disinformation and promoting clean and orderly elections.

The electoral tribunals can do the same to speed up the adjudication of protests involving the presidency, vice presidency and seats in Congress.

Part of promoting credible elections is ensuring that only those with the voters’ mandate are the ones who assume elective posts. And that those who break the law and election rules face appropriate punishment, implemented as quickly as possible.
