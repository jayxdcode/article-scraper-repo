Surveys show that public trust is slipping on the government’s commitment to hold accountable those who have stolen billions from public works projects.

President Marcos should want to prevent the trust from further slipping as he prepares to shut down the Independent Commission for Infrastructure. The President effectively confirmed speculation that the ICI is soon to be shuttered when he told reporters last Friday, when asked about the fate of the fact-finding body, that “they really are coming towards the end,” with just “one or two other loose ends” still to be cleared up.

All that the ICI was tasked to investigate has been investigated, the President pointed out, so the Office of the Ombudsman and the Department of Justice can now take over the work.

Since last year, similar statements have been made by Ombudsman Jesus Crispin Remulla and Palace officials, who said that the ICI tasks were becoming redundant. Remulla said the ICI was good for just another month or two, while the President’s sister, Sen. Imee Marcos, said the commission would be closed by Feb. 1.

With the President effectively confirming the end of the ICI, ML party-list Rep. Leila de Lima said the body now appears to have been “just an intermission number” to ease public outrage over the corruption scandal in flood control and other public works projects.

The remaining ICI commissioner, its chairman Andres Reyes, is reportedly indisposed and has not reported for work for about a week. ICI officials say they are finalizing their reports and recommendations to be submitted to relevant authorities.

With the ICI holding its most important sessions behind closed doors, it will not be strongly missed by the public. More awaited is the resumption of public hearings by the Senate Blue Ribbon committee led by Panfilo Lacson.

President Marcos, who initiated the anti-corruption crackdown with his “mahiya naman kayo” message in July last year, should want the Senate probe to complement rather than supplant the momentum of his campaign.

Uncertainty over accountability and reforms in connection with the corruption scandal has negatively impacted even the economy, scaring away investors and pulling growth below government targets.

When the ICI closes its doors for good, the President must show to a skeptical public that he is sincere in his commitment to accountability, and that the crackdown, instead of sputtering, is set to intensify, with the big fish caught. For real, this time.
