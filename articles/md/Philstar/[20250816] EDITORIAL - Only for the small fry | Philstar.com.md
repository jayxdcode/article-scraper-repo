It took over a decade from the commission of the crime, but on Aug. 12, former Quezon City councilor Dante de Guzman was sentenced by the Sandiganbayan to over 100 years in prison after being found guilty of paying P361,500 in salaries and benefits to non-existent or ghost employees.

Guilty verdicts can still be appealed. The case, however, has drawn national attention not only because of the long prison term imposed, but also because of the current focus on ghost flood control projects, which have cost billions in public funds.

President Marcos has initiated a probe into substandard and imagined or “guni-guni” flood control projects. A common question is whether anyone will face punishment. Lawmakers, who earmark projects for funding in the national budget, have been linked to certain contractors. The President has said he will turn his back on allies found to be involved in anomalous deals.

De Guzman was convicted over P361,500, which he was ordered to return to the Quezon City government, with a six-percent interest for every year from his conviction that he fails to comply.

The money was supposedly disbursed from June 2009 to June 2010 for the salaries, performance incentives and Christmas bonus of the ghost employees. De Guzman was found guilty of 16 counts of graft and 16 counts of malversation, with penalties ranging from six to 10 years for each count, although the maximum period of imprisonment in this country is 40 years.

This is just for P361,500. What about ghost employees in other agencies? The supposed reformist mode at Malacañang has not extended to the ghost employee scandal that led to the resignation last year of two members of the Monetary Board, the highest policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.

BSP officials carried out an internal probe of Anita Linda Aquino and V. Bruce Tolentino, who were appointed to the Monetary Board in 2020 by then president Rodrigo Duterte. The BSP submitted its findings to Malacañang for appropriate action.

Malacañang said it could not punish people who are no longer in government, although perhaps the Office of the Ombudsman could go after the two. With the ombudsman’s seat vacant, the case is in limbo.

The message here is that it’s OK to put ghost employees on the public payroll; if caught, the offender can simply resign and escape accountability.

Some folks do get convicted and meted stiff punishment – but only former councilors and other small fry. Those in top-paying jobs such as MB members are above the law. The nation could see the same selective justice in the case of lawmakers implicated in ghost flood control projects.
