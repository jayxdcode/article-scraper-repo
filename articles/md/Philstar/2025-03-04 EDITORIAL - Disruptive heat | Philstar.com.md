On the first regular working day of March, several local government units in Metro Manila and neighboring regions suspended classes in public schools yesterday.

The reason?

The weather bureau had warned that the heat index could reach a “dangerous” level of 46 degrees Celsius. The heat index is not the actual air temperature, but what it feels like to the human body when combined with relative humidity in shaded areas.

Living in the tropics, Filipinos are familiar with the health problems caused by high heat and humidity. People become enervated and unable to concentrate. Fainting spells and heat strokes are not uncommon.

The problem was highlighted after the academic calendar was altered by the two-year lockdown during the COVID pandemic. The school year was then extended to the dry season – the Philippine summer months from March to May.

Technology can mitigate “dangerous” levels of perceived or apparent temperature. Air-conditioning has been around for decades, allowing a wide range of human activities even in high-rises with little natural ventilation. In structures designed for natural air flow, electric fans help to ease the heat and humidity.

The forced alteration of the academic calendar exposed the dismal ventilation facilities in most public schools. Many classrooms did not have enough electric fans. Naturally, the problem was worse in large classes of 40 to 50 students. Teachers and learners alike could not concentrate on the lessons, forcing school administrators to suspend classes several times due to the high heat index in the summer of 2024.

The frequent class suspensions sped up the transition back to the pre-pandemic academic calendar, which is not yet in place, however, in the current school year.

With classes suspended yesterday due to the heat index, parents and education stakeholders are wondering how many more school days would be lost before the school year is over.

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said the northeast monsoon, which induced the cold spell, ended last week and the dry season is just starting. PAGASA said the heat has yet to peak, from the end of March through much of April.

How many more times will classes be suspended or forced to shift to remote learning due to the heat and humidity? Education stakeholders have said remote learning during the pandemic was unwieldy for teachers and students alike, and seriously set back formal education.

Even when the pre-pandemic academic calendar is fully restored and the annual school break again takes place during the dry season, the government should invest in providing sufficient ventilation to all public schools. In a tropical country, this is supposed to go without saying, if the education sector genuinely received the largest share of the national budget, as mandated by the Constitution.
