It’s a milder variant of mpox, and there is no lockdown anywhere in the country to contain the spread of mpox.

The Department of Health found it necessary to issue this clarification as information circulated online that a lockdown had been imposed in the country following the detection of mpox cases, with six confirmed in Davao City and two in Iloilo last week alone.

DOH and local government officials said there has been no community transmission of the disease. Mandatory masking is not even recommended by the DOH because the mpox virus is not airborne, unlike SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. Mpox is also self-limiting, resolving by itself in two to three weeks, health officials said.

Instead the disease is transmitted through skin-to-skin or prolonged face-to-face contact, with symptoms so similar to chickenpox that misdiagnosis is common.

Since last year, 911 mpox cases have been confirmed nationwide. But health officials prefer to look at the epidemic curve, with fewer than 50 cases recorded in May.

The DOH is more worried about the higher number of HIV infections, currently averaging 56 to 57 daily. DOH officials said several deaths initially attributed to mpox turned out to be due to HIV-AIDS or other life-threatening illnesses.

The disease, however, can be extremely painful and may leave permanent scars. Mpox produces larger and deeper skin lesions than chickenpox, appearing all at once unlike in the case of chickenpox.

Mpox can also be life-threatening to vulnerable sectors such as the elderly and those with HIV-AIDS and other comorbidities. So those afflicted must be properly diagnosed and identified by public health workers for proper isolation and contact tracing.

Health authorities should also intensify public information campaigns to promote preventive measures, such as regular hand washing, good personal hygiene and safe sex practices.

In areas where mpox cases have been confirmed, services that involve skin-to-skin contact such as spas and wellness centers, beauty salons and barber shops may be subjected to closer monitoring by health authorities, to promote preventive measures. This will be for the establishments’ own good, to ensure the health of their employees and clients alike and ultimately their businesses.

The COVID pandemic showed the importance of adhering to health protocols. People should not wait for the deadlier variant of the mpox virus to enter the country before practicing preventive measures.
