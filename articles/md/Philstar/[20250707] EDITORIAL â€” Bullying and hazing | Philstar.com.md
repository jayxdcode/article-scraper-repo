Just three weeks into the new school year, there are already reports of violent bullying in educational institutions.

At the Philippine Military Academy, where there are students who still seem to think violent hazing is part of the rite of passage to adulthood, four cadets may face criminal indictment for violation of Republic Act 11053, the Anti-Hazing Act.

The four have been tagged in the physical abuse that put 4th class cadet Mauee Bumagat Maraggun in the hospital. Although the alleged abuses were perpetrated in September last year, Maraggun was discharged from the hospital only on June 30.

Pending a formal investigation, the PMA has said two of the cadets have been suspended for a year. Initial penalties have also been slapped on Maraggun’s squad leader. A fourth cadet was cleared.

In Mindanao late last month, police apprehended two minors for bullying a classmate at the Basilan National High School. The victim’s father reported to the Isabela police station on June 26 that the minors wanted the victim to smoke. The father said that when the boy refused, he was punched and kicked by the minors and his head slammed against a wall several times. One of the minors also pulled out a knife and threatened to stab the victim, the father said.

How can students learn in such an environment? People who worry about their personal safety cannot focus on formal education.

The Philippines has been tagged as the bullying capital of the world, based on outcomes of the Program for International Student Assessment wherein Filipino 15-year-old students landed at the bottom. PISA administrators noted that apart from physical and verbal abuse, the bullying was also carried out through online harassment and social exclusion of the victim.

Results of the 2018 PISA – the first time that the country participated in the assessment – showed that 65 percent of Filipino Grade 10 students had experienced bullying at least a few times a month. This was the highest rate recorded among the countries that participated in the PISA.

Bullying can be stopped only if victims report the abuse. Most victims, however, worry about retaliation and possible ostracism as well as inaction by authorities. Victims should be assured of action on their complaints as well as protection from further harassment including by relatives or friends of the bullies.

Schools must implement mechanisms for reporting even anonymously cases of bullying and hazing. Counseling must also be provided to victims. Bullying can quickly spiral out of control, with consequences that can lead to death, so school authorities must be pro-active in confronting the problem.
