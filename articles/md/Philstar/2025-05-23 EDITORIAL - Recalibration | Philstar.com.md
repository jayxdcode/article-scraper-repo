No more business as usual – it’s time for Cabinet members to get out of their comfort zones.

President Marcos said this as he called on all his Cabinet-level officials to submit courtesy resignations yesterday. His call, which he said was about “performance, alignment and urgency,” was issued over a week after candidates of the administration’s Alyansa Senate slate fared badly in the midterm elections.

Of the 12 original Alyansa candidates, one dropped out and was endorsed by the Dutertes: the President’s sister, Sen. Imee Marcos. Another Alyansa bet, Las Piñas Rep. Camille Villar, was also endorsed by Vice President Sara Duterte.

Both Senator Marcos and Villar won, and are seen as part of the pro-Duterte bloc in the so-called Magic 12. The Alyansa managed to bag only five seats.

“The people have spoken, and they expect results – not politics, not excuses. We hear them, and we will act,” Marcos said, as quoted by the Presidential Communications Office. The PCO described the President’s call as “a decisive move to recalibrate his administration following the results of the recent elections.”

Given the sweeping changes that Marcos may implement within his official family, public expectations will be high that the shakeup will result in significant improvements in government services.

The President must ensure that these high expectations will not be disappointed. He is midway through his six-year term – time enough to make a dent in the many problems faced by the nation, which have been aggravated by corruption, inefficiency and the selfish greed of certain people in government, including his allies.

In his official statement, the President said there will be recognition for Cabinet members “who have delivered and continue to deliver… but we cannot afford to be complacent.” The PCO also noted that many officials have served “with dedication and professionalism.”

Shortly after the elections, Marcos had said a performance review was underway, and he would remove those who do not perform well. The government, he said, must be realigned with the people’s expectations.

This new phase of the Marcos administration, according to the PCO, promises to be “sharper, faster, and fully focused on the people’s most pressing needs.”

The public will hold the administration to this promise.
