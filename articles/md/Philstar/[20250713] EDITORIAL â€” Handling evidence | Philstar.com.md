Three to four years after 34 cockfighting enthusiasts went missing, the first big break has emerged that may lead to the truth about what happened. That is if probers do not bungle the probe.

Beginning Thursday, Philippine Coast Guard and police personnel started unearthing what appear to be human skeletal remains around Taal Lake in Batangas. The first batch was found by police in a shallow area near the lakeshore in Laurel town.

On Friday afternoon, at least two more sacks were separately found by PCG divers farther away from the shoreline and in deeper spots.

Seeing images of the retrieval operations, Dr. Raquel Fortun expressed concern about the handling of the evidence and protection of the supposed burial area.

Fortun is one of only two forensic pathologists in the country, the other one being Dr. Ma. Cecilia Lim. Fortun chairs the Pathology Department of the University of the Philippines Manila’s College of Medicine. Lim is the deputy.

Considering the high number of homicides nationwide, the country should have a pool of forensic pathologists – professionals with the scientific knowhow to examine possible victims of criminal attacks and determine the cause of death.

With the country just starting to develop this pool, however, probers should at least have sufficient training in preserving crime scenes. After concerns were raised about the handling of the first batch of skeletal remains retrieved in the Taal Lake area, divers took pains to show that they were more careful in handling the sacks that were found on Friday.

PCG and police officers were tipped off about the supposed burial area by Julie Patidongan, one of six security personnel at the Manila Arena who were arrested and charged with kidnapping and serious illegal detention of six of the 34 missing sabungeros.

The six victims from Tanay, Rizal were seen on surveillance video being herded by the suspects into a van on the night of Jan. 13, 2022. Judge Rebecca Guillen Ubaña of the Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 40 approved bail of P3 million, allowing the  release of the six. Who paid the bail?

Patidongan has since claimed that up to 108 sabungeros were kidnapped and killed by a gang of about 30, of whom about 20 were policemen. The bodies were burned and the remains weighed down and tossed into Taal Lake, he said.

Fortun said the skeletal remains could still be viable for DNA testing and identification. That is if the integrity of the evidence can be secured for forensic laboratory scrutiny.
