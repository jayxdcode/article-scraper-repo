Thirty-eight years after the Constitution was ratified, there is a move at the House of Representatives to finally pass an enabling law for the constitutional prohibition on political dynasties.

Because of the eternal wait for the enabling law, the Supreme Court has been asked by several petitioners to step in and compel Congress to pass the needed legislation. The SC has yet to rule on the petition.

In the meantime, Speaker Faustino Dy III has urged his House colleagues to support proposed anti-dynasty measures, notably a bill filed by the Akbayan party-list. Such support in a dynasty-packed chamber will test the commitment of its members to accountability and meaningful reforms.

Dy himself belongs to one of the country’s entrenched dynasties. As he declared in his statement of assets, liabilities and net worth, he has 16 relatives in government, three of them including his son Faustino V and nephews Faustino Michael III and Ian Paul sitting in the House itself.

Such a situation has become the rule rather than the exception not only in Congress but also in the national and local governments.

Dy, in his call to his colleagues, acknowledged criticisms of his own clan, which he described as a family with a “long-standing tradition of service to the country.” At the same time, he noted that public service is not “inherited” but is “entrusted” by the people.

There are reports that Dy’s call to back an anti-dynasty law has the blessings of President Marcos, who is also a member of an entrenched dynasty. But even if the measure hurdles the House, a bigger question is whether a counterpart bill can hurdle the Senate.

The current composition of the Senate illustrates how politics has become a family business. With just 24 seats, there are three sets of siblings in the chamber. Several other senators belong to political dynasties.

Simply defining a dynasty is likely to be a contentious issue. Laws against graft and corruption cover relatives within the fourth civil degree of affinity or consanguinity.

Still, if this anti-dynasty initiative becomes law, it would be a landmark legislation that could help restore public trust in Congress and the executive. This reform is long overdue.
