From the commission of the crime until final conviction for graft, it took 17 years for the case against Emilio Ramon “ER” Ejercito III to be resolved.

Last Oct. 20, the Sandiganbayan’s Fourth Division ordered the arrest of Ejercito and businesswoman Marilyn Bruel so they can start serving their sentence of up to eight years in prison over the grant of an insurance contract to Bruel’s company, First Rapids Care Ventures or FRCV.

The two, along with several Pagsanjan councilors, were indicted by the Office of the Ombudsman in 2016. In April 2019, the Sandiganbayan found Ejercito guilty of graft. This was for giving unwarranted benefits to FRCV in the insurance deal covering Pagsanjan boatmen and tourists at the Pagsanjan Gorge Tourist Zone.

Court records show that the contract was awarded without public bidding in October 2008 to FRCV, which lacked a certificate of authority from the Insurance Commission, and which was registered with the Department of Trade and Industry and the Bureau of Internal Revenue just five days before it offered its services to Ejercito. The BIR registration described FRCV as a computer business, the SC noted.

The conviction by the Sandigan included the accessory penalties of perpetual disqualification from holding public office, cancellation of civil service eligibility and forfeiture of retirement benefits.

Yet the penalties had to await final conviction, which meant the case had to go through the judicial mill until the Supreme Court ruled with finality. In February this year, the SC upheld the conviction of Ejercito and Bruel, but cleared five former Pagsanjan councilors for lack of evidence.

Because the SC ruling could still be appealed and the conviction was not yet final and executory, Ejercito was allowed to run for mayor of Pagsanjan last May – and to assume the post after his victory.

Last month, the SC denied the appeals of Ejercito and Bruel. After receiving the entry of judgment from the SC, the Sandiganbayan ordered Ejercito and Bruel arrested and to begin serving their sentence.

It took nine years, from the time the case was filed by the ombudsman in 2016, for the final ruling to be handed down. During that period, Ejercito was free to remain in public office, although he lost in three consecutive elections before winning this year.

Those in charge of the legal system must do more to speed up the administration of justice. The law is supposed to serve as a deterrent to crime. But seeing those accused of corruption still seeking elective office and working in government is not a deterrent, but an encouragement to keep breaking the law.
