Here’s another reason why it’s time to break the bad habit of repeatedly postponing the barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections on the whim of the BSK officials’ political patrons.

The Department of the Interior and Local Government has announced an investigation of what netizens described as a three-day “junket” of Manila SK members to Thailand. The DILG ordered the probe after online posts of the trip showed the SK members enjoying boat rides in a floating market in Bangkok and riding and feeding elephants in a park.

Such activities didn’t look anything like “capacity development training course and international benchmarking” – the description of the SK federation for the trip in a country with no counterpart for the Philippine youth council system.

The SK Federation of Manila said the trip was held in partnership with St. Robert’s International College in Thailand, and was meant to boost the SK officials’ competencies in addressing HIV cases in the Philippines.

Exactly what competencies were being referred to is unclear. It’s common knowledge that the best way to prevent HIV is to practice safe sex or, if possible, abstinence. Philippine health officials have not been remiss in their reminders to the public to get tested for HIV if they practice unsafe sex, because early diagnosis and treatment is critical in keeping the affliction from progressing into full-blown AIDS.

For the trip, each of the 667 out of 896 Manila SK officials who participated reportedly received P33,990 for airfare, food and accommodation, plus a daily subsistence allowance of P6,000, or P18,000 for three days. That’s P51,990 per person, or P34,677,330 for the 667 participants. If Filipino taxpayers bankrolled that trip, aren’t there better uses for nearly P35 million in public funds?

Critics of the trip were particularly dismayed that it took place amid public outrage over budget insertions and the trillions reportedly lost to corruption in flood control projects alone.

And those responsible for foisting the most corrupt national budget ever also passed, in the final days of the previous Congress, a law postponing for the nth time the BSKE, extending the terms of barangay and SK officials for yet another year, and even giving them a longer term of four years. What did they do to deserve this? The barangays couldn’t even be counted on to check if flood control projects were actually being carried out.

Elections – regular, on schedule – allow the public to replace profligate, negligent and non-performing public officials. The Supreme Court must decisively put its foot down on the repeated term extensions for BSK officials.
