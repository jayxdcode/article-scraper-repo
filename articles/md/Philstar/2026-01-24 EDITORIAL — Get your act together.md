Hello, is anyone minding the store?

That question is being asked as the administration tries to kick out Nicolas Torre III from the Philippine National Police in a chaotic manner.

The National Police Commission announced that Torre had optionally retired from the PNP, paving the way for Jose Melencio Nartatez Jr. to assume the top police post in a regular capacity, with four-star rank.

Only one four-star general is allowed in the PNP. But Torre immediately said he had neither applied for nor signed any document seeking optional retirement.

Napolcom officials then clarified that Torre did not retire but had “ipso facto” or effectively resigned effective Dec. 26, 2025, after he accepted the post of general manager of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority. Whether this arrangement was made clear to Torre when the MMDA post was offered to him is unclear.

Torre has said he would seek clarification on this because he has not resigned from the PNP. He still has two months in the service before reaching the retirement age of 56 on March 11, 2026.

A person cannot hold two
government positions simultaneously, according to Interior Secretary and Napolcom ex-officio chairman Jonvic Remulla. Whether being on floating status in the PNP counts as a second government post, however, may need clarity from the courts.

Technology has made communication so much easier. Can’t anyone in the administration message Torre and tell him to get out of the PNP, wait for his reply, take a screenshot of the message thread and present this to the nation? Or else someone can call him, inform him that it’s a recorded conversation, and clarify his status in the PNP.

The best approach, of course, is for one of his superiors to sit down with Torre and tell him directly that the Marcos administration wants him out of the police service.

The PNP chief serves at the pleasure of the President, but forced removal from the service is another matter and must be for cause.

Even the reason for Torre’s ouster as PNP chief last August remains murky. It was ordered by the Napolcom ostensibly for insubordination, following Torre’s run-in with Remulla.

But Torre was never charged with insubordination, and was instead offered a carrot – the MMDA post. His acceptance of this position was deemed as resignation from the PNP, according to Remulla and Malacañang. But shouldn’t something so important in a police officer’s career be backed by an official, signed declaration of intent to leave the service?

Last Thursday, Malacañang attributed the issue to a misunderstanding and said Torre had optionally retired. Perhaps Remulla and Torre should just settle their differences in a boxing bout, to spare the nation from the ugly spectacle of disorganized governance.
