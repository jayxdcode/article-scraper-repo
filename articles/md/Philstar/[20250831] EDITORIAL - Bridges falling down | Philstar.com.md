Even before the final report is out on the collapse of a brand-new bridge in Isabela province, another bridge gave way as a truck transporting gravel passed through it on Thursday in Camalig, Albay.

The bridge in Ilawod village is made of steel and concrete, but was designed only for light vehicles, according to the Municipal Engineering Office. According to reports quoting residents, the truck driver might have used the bridge because of ongoing construction work of a road and dike.

If the story is accurate, isn’t there an alternate route in Ilawod for delivery trucks, especially those with heavy loads? The transport of materials cannot stand prolonged delays. There are delivery and work schedules to be followed and completion deadlines to be met.

Were the truck driver and owner of the hauling firm aware of the load limit on the bridge? Ignorance of the law excuses no one, so they are likely to be held liable for damage to public infrastructure. If the normal route for delivery trucks could not be used, however, the public should have been informed about alternate routes and load limits on the bridge.

As of Friday, news reports said people were still crossing the bridge on foot, despite the risks to their safety and of greater damage to the structure. The barangay office, local government and public works engineers could have quickly coordinated to prevent this.

Even if it was a minor bridge, public funds were lost in that collapse, and more public funds are needed for its reconstruction and possibly the provision of an alternate bridge. If the crooked MO in public works that is now coming to light will be followed, the reconstruction could run into billions due to the layering of the project into multiple phases, with kickbacks at every phase.

The case is a reminder that the nation is still waiting for the findings of a special committee formed to investigate the collapse of the Cabagan-Santa Maria bridge in Isabela last February. Ten years in the making, and built at a cost of P1.22 billion, the bridge gave way as a truck transporting rocks passed through it.

Until early this month, the Department of Public Works and Highways was sticking to its initial assessment that the truck had disregarded weight limits on the bridge and caused the collapse. It’s uncertain if this is part of the findings of the DPWH special probe committee, which was supposed to submit its report on April 25.

These two incidents highlight two things. One is that bridges require better protection. Another is that the DPWH must not be tasked to lead probes into its own projects.
