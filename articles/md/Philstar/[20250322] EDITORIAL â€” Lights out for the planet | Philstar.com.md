For one hour on the night of March 22, people in 190 countries will switch off non-essential lights.

Beyond an hour-long lights out, organizers of Earth Hour are urging participants to do something they enjoy that is good for the planet. This can include activities involving not only nature and sustainability but also entertainment, arts and creativity, fitness and wellness as well as food.

Organizers are also hoping that the planet-friendly activities can go beyond one hour. The activities include the typical ones for the environment, such as conserving water, cleaning up and planting a tree. Also encouraged are riding a bicycle instead of a car, recycling leftover food and going for plant-based meals.

“Individual actions can lead to big change,” organizer World Wide Fund for Nature declared, as it encouraged people to “reconnect with and give back to our planet.”

March 22 is also World Water Day. Water is the most basic human need for survival. The WWF points out that freshwater ecosystems are under threat, with declining populations of aquatic species and biodiversity collapsing.

This threat is keenly felt in the Philippines, one of the countries at highest risk from the impact of climate change. Even in Metro Manila, unbridled reclamation activities are threatening Laguna de Bay, a major source of fresh water and fish, as well as Manila Bay. Wetlands across the country are under serious threat.

The country enjoys high biodiversity, but this is under threat from unplanned development with complete disregard for fragile ecosystems. Efforts are spotty and uncoordinated in promoting sustainable exploitation of forests and other natural resources. Numerous species of Philippine flora and fauna are endangered and face extinction.

Coral networks, which are breeding grounds for marine life and take a long time to regenerate, have dwindled from illegal coral harvesting, destructive fishing methods and pollution. In the West Philippine Sea, the problem has been aggravated by China’s illegal construction of artificial islands on coral reefs.

“Nature needs us now more than ever,” the WWF said. “Our forests, oceans, freshwater systems and grasslands are crucial for wildlife and for us, and they need our help. Together, we can turn the tide.”

The symbolic one hour of commitment to saving the planet is good. Even better, make the commitment 24 hours. Make it 24/7.
