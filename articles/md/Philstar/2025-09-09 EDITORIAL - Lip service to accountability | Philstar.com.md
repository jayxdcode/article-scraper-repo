With no one else nominated for the post, Vicente Sotto III was installed yesterday as the new Senate president, replacing Francis Escudero.

There were no fireworks on the floor as the top Senate post was declared vacant and the new leaders of the chamber, mainly from the former minority bloc, were nominated and confirmed.

It was touching to listen to certain senators mouthing platitudes to integrity and accountability in public office. They were the same senators who voted overwhelmingly to effectively bury the impeachment complaint filed against Vice President Sara Duterte over issues involving utilization of public funds and accountability. Two of them even jumped from the minority to join the majority in that vote.

Today they seem to have had an epiphany, amid public anger over large-scale corruption that has produced substandard and even non-existent flood control projects. The defective and ghost projects have led to massive destruction, deaths and hospitalization from critical illnesses such as leptospirosis.

The corruption has been attributed to an unholy collusion among lawmakers, contractors and Department of Public Works and Highways officials.

Yesterday, billionaire contractors Curlee and Sarah Discaya added to the list of lawmakers and DPWH officials already implicated in questionable flood control projects.

Some quarters said the statement of the Discayas, who have found themselves attaining nationwide notoriety practically overnight, was a blend of truth and lies.

On the other hand, Malaca√±ang said the government is ready to provide protection to the Discayas as authorities study the possibility of allowing the couple to serve as state witnesses.

The public expects truth and sincerity not only from the Discayas, but also from lawmakers who have been mouthing commitments to integrity, transparency and accountability in government service.

Only time and other controversial issues will show if these commitments are sincere or merely lip service born of the exigencies of the times.

Lawmakers may show their sincerity initially by following the lead of the Akbayan party-list congressmen and voluntarily releasing their statements of assets and liabilities.

They can also show consistency in their commitment to transparency and accountability as Congress tackles many other controversial issues in the coming months.
