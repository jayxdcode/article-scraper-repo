For motorists and commuters alike, it was the stuff of nightmares: the busiest thoroughfare in Metro Manila would be shut down for up to two years, ostensibly to make way for repairs in time for Manila’s hosting of the ASEAN summit in 2026.

Amid the public uproar, President Marcos said the plan was “unacceptable” and sent the proposal back to the drawing board.

Yesterday, the DPWH announced that the rehabilitation plan had been reworked. But the case highlights the willy-nilly crafting and implementation of infrastructure projects in what has become the poster agency for corruption and incompetence in government, the DPWH.

The original rehab price tag of P17 billion has been pulled down to just P6 billion max, which DPWH officials say could still go lower. The rehabilitation period has also been cut from two years to just eight months, with the most disruptive part of Phase One reduced to less than two weeks.

Phase One of the EDSA rehab begins at 11 p.m. on Dec. 24, Christmas Eve, and ends at 4 a.m. on Jan. 5, the first day of classes and most office work in 2026. Reblocking will be done only in the portions where repairs will be undertaken.

Then DPWH secretary Manuel Bonoan had announced that EDSA would have to be closed for 17 months, except for the busway, beginning last June 13 until 2027, with the major phase of the repairs expected to be finished in time for the country’s hosting of the ASEAN summit next year.

The Guadalupe Bridge, also one of the busiest in Metro Manila, was also set to be closed last  October for seismic and structural retrofitting, the DPWH announced. This plan has also been postponed, possibly to 2027, as the DPWH reassesses the plan and studies the construction of a temporary structure to absorb vehicular traffic while the repairs are undertaken.

Because of the flood control corruption scandal and the collapse of a brand-new bridge this year, the plans for EDSA and Guadalupe Bridge raised suspicions that they were meant for kickback opportunities. Yesterday’s announcement of a reworked rehab plan reinforced the suspicions.

Perhaps Gerard Opulencia, the DPWH district engineer for Metro Manila can shed light on it. Last Tuesday, Opulencia turned over P40 million in cold cash to the Department of Justice – the first tranche of P150 million that he admitted skimming off from DPWH projects.

At least the massive disruption from the closure of EDSA has been averted. But the people deserve to know who was behind the original idea, with a price tag that is triple what is now being proposed.
