With the message that he feels the people’s pain, President Marcos has announced a redirection of his approach to the illegal drug scourge.

Administration officials say the new tack will have a heightened focus on the micro entrepreneurs of the illegal drug trade, even as the campaign against large-scale drug traffickers continues.

The new approach inevitably raises comparisons to that of the previous administration, wherein thousands of people mostly from impoverished communities were killed by state forces on mere suspicion of involvement in the illegal drug trade.

The nation is still struggling to render justice in those killings. Aware of the concerns, the Marcos administration has stressed that even with the new focus on arresting minor drug offenders, police will be directed to uphold human rights.

How the new crackdown will be implemented will be closely watched. Small-scale drug pushers typically operate in their own neighborhoods, selling shabu by the sachet, party drugs by packs of a few pills or even per marijuana stick.

Such pushers are often seen as troublemakers in their communities, with drug abuse seen as a factor in lawlessness. Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal crackdown on illegal drugs enjoyed a measure of public support even in communities that were the principal targets of Oplan Tokhang because residents tired of criminality liked the idea of troublemakers being quickly and decisively eliminated from their neighborhoods.

Penny-ante pushers are often drug abusers themselves who sell prohibited substances in retail amounts to support their addiction. Exterminating drug pushers like vermin even before guilt is established may be OK for people tired of lawlessness, until it is their loved ones who are targeted for execution.

A redirection of the anti-drug campaign must also be complemented by an intensified effort to stop drug smuggling. Drug busts indicate that illegal drugs continue to enter the country on a large scale. Systemic loopholes and corruption have been blamed for this. The government will also have to tighten monitoring of private ports, through which a wide range of contraband can easily be unloaded.

It’s good to see the government responding to public concerns over criminality. Numerous cases also support perceptions of a link between the illegal drug menace and crime.

Still, the government cannot ignore lessons imparted in the bloody anti-drug campaign during the previous administration. Going after neighborhood drug pushers should be part of a multi-pronged approach to public safety, starting with heightened and efficient police presence.
