No long lines. No fixers. No corruption.

These are the benefits promised by President Marcos as he rolled out yesterday the Bagong Pilipinas eGovPH Super App and the eGovPH Serbisyo Hub. The hub is meant to serve as a one-stop shop for both national and local government services.

At the launch, the President touted that the Philippine bureaucracy and local government units “have finally moved into the 21st century.”

It’s been 25 years since the start of the new millennium. Compared with several of its Asian neighbors, the Philippines is already late in going into widespread automation of government services. It’s one of the reasons why the country lags behind the founding members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in ease of doing business.

But it’s good to be catching up. The challenge now is to ensure that the transition to automation is as seamless as possible. The app and hub must be user-friendly. Red tape can be designed even into automated systems. The steps and requirements in eGov must also be streamlined to eliminate redundancies and simplify doing business with the government.

Automation requires good internet connectivity, and the government must move to make this as widespread and reliable as possible. In areas with limited internet services, the President said LGUs will set up centers for public walk-in access to the Serbisyo Hubs.

The government must be able to guarantee a comfortable level of cybersecurity for personal data required for government transactions, especially those involving payments or fund transfers. Artificial intelligence has facilitated cyberscams.

Recognizing one of the roadblocks, the President also promised to complete national ID coverage, including the release of physical ID cards that many people still prefer.

The eGov launch calls for higher public awareness of the automated services. Alongside the awareness campaign, anti-cybercrime units must be on high alert for attempts to clone the sites for use in scams.

AI has made it even more difficult to spot fake news and disinformation. The possibility of being scammed online will be among the hurdles in the transition to e-governance. Those behind eGovPH must make sure that they stay one step ahead of online scammers.  The eGov app and service hub must live up to the promise.
