Corruption affects all aspects of government services. The current focus is on flood control, due to massive flooding last month that forced the suspension of classes and government work for a week in Metro Manila and several other areas in Luzon.

But apart from flood control, the Department of Education is also calling attention to the slow construction of classrooms. A Senate inquiry showed that it took up to three years to finish the construction of classrooms, at a cost of at least P2.5 million each. Little wonder that public schools under DepEd have a shortage of 165,000 classrooms.

This situation has prompted Education Secretary Sonny Angara to propose removing from the Department of Public Works and Highways the sole authority to construct classrooms. The Department of Budget and Management has committed to include a special provision for this in the 2026 General Appropriations Act.

Beyond removing this sole authority from the DPWH, the government must find out why it takes three years to finish one classroom. A two-story house can be finished in a matter of months.

The lack of classrooms means larger class sizes, which is not conducive to learning. Some schools have been forced to shorten regular class hours to allow classrooms to be used in two or three shifts a day.

Experts have warned that the country faces an education crisis. Results of the Program for International Student Assessment are just among the glaring illustrations of the problem, with Filipino 15-year-olds ranking at the bottom compared with their peers.

Education experts have long cited the factors that have contributed to the crisis, led by a shortage of both human resources and learning facilities. These include teachers, school equipment, even clean water for handwashing, and yes, school buildings and classrooms.

The PISA study emphasized another problem: bullying in school. The Philippines has been tagged as the bullying capital of the world, affecting academic performance, according to the PISA study. But the country also lacks mental health professionals to deal with this problem.

It will take time before enough mental health professionals can be deployed to all public schools. But reducing the shortage of classrooms should be less challenging, especially since the private sector has been pitching in to address the problem.

And yet we have a shortage of 165,000 classrooms. It indicates not just inefficiency and incompetence, but possible criminal acts.
