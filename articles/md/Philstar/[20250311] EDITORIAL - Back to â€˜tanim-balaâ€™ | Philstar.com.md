As of yesterday, three employees of the Office for Transportation Security had been relieved from their posts at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Transportation Secretary Vince Dizon sacked the OTS personnel who were caught in a viral video going after a Filipino passenger and stopping her from boarding a flight to Vietnam.

The reason? The OTS personnel told the passenger that they found an amulet made of bullet casing in her carry-on bag. The woman was supposed to fly to Vietnam with her family on March 6, and posted her experience online.

The incident sparked concerns about the return of the “laglag-bala” or “tanim-bala” extortion scheme from 2015 to 2016, in which NAIA screening personnel were accused of dropping or planting bullets or casings in the carry-ons of passengers and then demanding payoffs.

In the latest incident, Dizon explained that the three OTS personnel were sacked even while investigation is ongoing about possible “tanim-bala” because they had breached airport protocols by stopping the passenger at the boarding gate, after she had already been cleared to take her flight.

The protocol is that passengers must be accosted or confronted about suspicious content in their luggage as they pass through security screening.

Amulets made of bullet casings are common in the Philippines. But the discovery of such items in the possession of passengers must not be used for shakedowns.

The incident highlights the importance of sustained vigilance at the NAIA and other airports across the country. This is not the first incident involving OTS personnel. Previous scandals have linked them to other irregularities including the theft of cash from passengers.

In September 2023, a female OTS employee was seen on surveillance video eating what officials said were bills worth $300 that a passenger had reported missing after going through security screening. The woman, who claimed what she ate was chocolate, and three other OTS personnel were immediately suspended.

In February 2023, another female OTS employee drew flak for “unprofessional behavior” as members of popular K-pop group Enhypen went through security checks at the NAIA. The manual frisking by the giggling fangirl was recorded on video, in violation of airport protocols.

The positive development in the latest “tanim-bala” incident is that it was caught on surveillance camera and the OTS personnel were relieved. Seeing sanctions imposed is the best deterrent to a repeat of wrongdoing.
