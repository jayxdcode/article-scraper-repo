On Nov. 11 last year, as the trail in the flood control scandal started leading to his doorstep, Manuel Bonoan left the country ostensibly for medical reasons.

He had indicated he would return on Dec. 17, according to the Bureau of Immigration, but apparently decided to have a merry Christmas in the United States.

By that time, Bonoan was covered by an immigration lookout bulletin order and facing an administrative case in connection with a P72.4-million non-existent or ghost riverbank flood control project in Bulacan undertaken by the Department of Public Works and Highways.

The former DPWH secretary was also deemed liable by the Independent Commission for Infrastructure for another ghost flood control project in the same province worth P95.04 million.

Last Wednesday, Sen. Panfilo Lacson, who will soon be resuming the flood control probe of the Blue Ribbon committee, said Bonoan also “deliberately” misled Malacañang and provided incorrect grid coordinates on the locations of thousands of flood control projects that were in the Sumbong sa Pangulo website.

Malacañang is verifying Lacson’s claim. Bonoan is among about a dozen people summoned by the Blue Ribbon to appear when the committee resumes its probe into the flood control mess.

In the meantime, Bonoan has reportedly sought a one-month extension of his stay in California ostensibly because his wife’s eye operation has been moved to February.

He is no longer in government and doesn’t have to report for work regularly. But he is also facing serious accusations of criminal offenses, and the sooner he addresses them squarely, the more believable it will be for him to invoke innocence.

The longer he stays outside the reach of Philippine authorities, the more he is starting to look like resigned Ako Bicol party-list congressman Elizaldy Co, now officially a fugitive from justice and facing plunder and graft cases.

When Bonoan returned to the DPWH as its chief in 2022, he had warned that he would go after crooks and those who would try to “shortchange” the department in the infrastructure projects of the Marcos administration.

In September last year, after the corruption scandal forced him to resign from the DPWH, Bonoan said he is not corrupt, and that “I am not involved” in the ghost flood control projects.

He can prove this only if he returns home and faces the charges squarely.
