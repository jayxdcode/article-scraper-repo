The rotten schemes employed to siphon public funds into private pockets are surely not unique to flood control projects undertaken by the Department of Public Works and Highways.

The DPWH is also in charge of constructing national roads, bridges, public schools and classrooms. If crooks in the DPWH and Congress and their accomplices in the private sector can get kickbacks even from flood control projects in creeks and other small waterways, they will surely find opportunities for thievery in other types of projects.

Road and bridge projects – including the installation of road safety devices – are expected to also come under scrutiny for corruption.

Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong has long sounded the alarm about the procurement of overpriced rock netting, traffic barriers and cat’s eyes. Scores have died and roads damaged in mudslides despite the installation of rock netting.

The nation is still waiting for the official findings on the collapse of the brand-new, P1.225-billion Cabagan-Santa Maria bridge last February in Isabela province.

Authorities must also find out if crooked schemes have caused the current backlog of 165,000 classrooms, and if school buildings are also substandard.

The long-running shortage of classrooms has prompted the private sector to chip in for many years now in reducing the backlog.

Education Secretary Sonny Angara said recently that his department has secured over P458 million in commitments so far from the private sector for the construction of classrooms.

For a stronger and more efficient response to the shortage, Angara is proposing to allow selected local government units to handle the construction of classrooms in the LGUs’ jurisdictions. Only LGUs with the capacity and resources for this will be given the task.

While his proposal is being considered, experts can be tapped to compare the project specs with the finished product in the school buildings and classrooms constructed by the DPWH. If the department can build low-grade and non-existent flood control projects, the possibility of substandard and ghost classrooms isn’t farfetched.
