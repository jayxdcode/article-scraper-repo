An unsigned document containing allegations of corruption against Bureau of Immigration Commissioner Joel Anthony Viado has reached Malacañang. Viado has dismissed the accusations as “patently false” and part of a “well-funded” smear campaign against him and the BI.

Yesterday, Viado released a statement disclosing a failed attempt to release on bail from BI custody Tony Yang, brother of former president Rodrigo Duterte’s economic adviser Michael Yang. Tony Yang was arrested at the NAIA-3 last year for being an undesirable alien, and is under probe for alleged links to illegal POGOs and misrepresenting himself as a Filipino. Viado, however, could not say if Yang’s case is linked to the anonymous complaints against him.

Although the document dated June 2 supposedly from BI employees is anonymous, President Marcos said yesterday that his administration is looking into the allegations, which accuse Viado of mishandling cases involving Philippine offshore gaming operators.

POGO-related scandals have hit the BI since the operations were allowed during the Duterte administration. Law enforcement agencies noted that foreigners were allowed to enter the country on tourist visas but ended up working in POGOs that operated as scam hubs. The anomalous entry was reportedly facilitated by unscrupulous BI employees under the so-called pastillas scheme, named after the grease money rolled up and wrapped in paper like the local milk pastry and paid to the BI by the foreigners.

In 2022, the Office of the Ombudsman ordered the dismissal of over 40 immigration officials and agents for involvement in the pastillas scandal.

The administration has been encouraging people to blow the whistle on crooks in government. Many people, however, worry about retaliation especially if the crooks are the whistle-blowers’ superiors, and would prefer to remain anonymous in reporting wrongdoing. On the other hand, smear campaigns are all too common in this country. The government will have to strike a balance between encouraging citizen vigilance against wrongdoing in public office and subjecting honest officials to harassment.

As the allegations against Viado are investigated, authorities must also verify his story about a smear campaign against him and the BI. If true, the perpetrators must be caught and meted punishment.
