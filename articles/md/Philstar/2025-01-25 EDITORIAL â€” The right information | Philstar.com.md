In the Information Age, children can access a mountain of materials about sex online. Most of these are porn sites, which can feature degrading, perverted and violent sexual acts. A number of the sites may even feature various forms of sexual exploitation of children.

The aim of comprehensive sexuality education in schools is to provide age-appropriate and, most importantly, accurate information about sexuality and the reproductive system. Apart from preventing teenage pregnancy and the spread of HIV among youths, CSE alerts children about inappropriate touching and acts of sexual molestation by older people so that these can be avoided or, when experienced by a child, reported to authorities.

“Authorities” may not refer to a molested child’s parents or guardians. There have been too many cases of child sexual abuse and exploitation, both online and in person, perpetrated by parents or guardians themselves. This happens particularly in low-income households, where children are seen as breadwinners by adults who can’t find decent employment or livelihood sources. Children of overseas workers who are left in the care of guardians are also vulnerable.

Opponents of the bill that seeks to prevent teenage pregnancy are correct in stressing that parents have the primary responsibility of teaching their children about sexuality and reproductive matters. This presumes that the children are willing to discuss such matters with their parents. And it presumes that the children live in normal households where they are not subjected to abuse and exploitation by the adults.

As child welfare advocates have pointed out, however, too many cases of in-person and online sexual abuse and exploitation of children are perpetrated by older relatives of the victims. Studies showed a spike in cases of OSAEC during the pandemic lockdowns. Cooped up at home with their tormentors, the young victims were unable to seek help from authorities in school or the community.

President Marcos is reportedly reviewing the substitute measure that amends contentious provisions in a Senate bill seeking to prevent teenage pregnancy. The President had previously said that sex education in school is “very, very, very important” to prevent teenage pregnancy and HIV.

Concerns raised by certain sectors cannot be ignored; sex education works best when it is adapted to cultural norms and social values. CSE, however, cannot be tossed out the window because of baseless fears. In the digital age, it’s impossible to keep children in the dark about sex. It’s better for them to get accurate and science-based information from adults in school, instead of having them rely on porn sites, or proceeding headlong into sexual exploration.
