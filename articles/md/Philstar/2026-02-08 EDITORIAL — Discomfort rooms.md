Until a few years before the COVID pandemic, washrooms with inadequate water and without toilet paper were among the top complaints at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport.

Washrooms at all three NAIA terminals have since improved, along with those in other international airports in the country.

In many other public transport facilities across the islands, however, inadequate washrooms remain a problem. These include seaports, minor airports and road transport terminals.

The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board has announced that it has summoned 57 operators of terminals for passenger buses and other public utility vehicles over their dilapidated facilities including toilets and waiting areas.

LTFRB officials said they received complaints about mass transportation terminals that lacked working washrooms, while others charged fees for toilet use. Several terminals lacked facilities for persons with disabilities and senior citizens, the LTFRB said.

The officials stressed that the LTFRB is not demanding high-end transport terminals, but only compliance with basic requirements for decent mass transport operations, including cleanliness, safety and a modicum of comfort while waiting for a ride.

Filipinos call washrooms comfort rooms. But across the country, even in several top travel destinations, public toilet facilities are sources of discomfort. There is no toilet paper and water for handwashing or even flushing. The facilities are filthy.

Modern public washrooms are available mainly in shopping malls, major fast-food chains and dining areas and certain gas stations. There are many areas, in the country, however, without these commercial establishments, and where even dining areas lack decent washrooms.

One problem, especially outside urban centers, is the inadequacy of water and sanitation facilities. Even public schools in certain areas lack running water for regular handwashing – a basic health requirement.

The national and local governments must step up efforts to provide modern water and sanitation facilities, not only to promote public health but also to stimulate tourism across the country.

Personal comfort is a critical component of travel enjoyment. Comfort rooms must be provided in public places, and they must live up to their name.
