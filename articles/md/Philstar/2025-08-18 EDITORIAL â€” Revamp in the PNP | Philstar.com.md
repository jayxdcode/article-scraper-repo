Who has the power to assign officers in the Philippine National Police?

Each time a new PNP chief assumes the post, it is almost always followed by a sweeping revamp in the police organization.

This time, however, the National Police Commission, which is chaired by Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla, has issued a resolution reversing and modifying appointments in key PNP posts made by its new chief Gen. Nicolas Torre III. The PNP chief is a member of the Napolcom.

Republic Act 6975, the Department of the Interior and Local Government Act of 1990, gives the Napolcom “administrative control” over the PNP. The Napolcom, which crafts policy and imposes disciplinary action on PNP members, has also invoked its administrative power over the police force, as provided under the Constitution.

On the other hand, RA 6975 also defines the powers of the PNP chief. Under Section 26 of the law, these include “the power to direct and control tactical as well as strategic movements, deployment, placement, utilization of the PNP or any of its units and personnel, including its equipment, facilities and other resources.”

Some reports said the top Napolcom officials were apparently miffed that Torre carried out a sweeping PNP revamp without giving the commission a heads up. Is this, however, a requirement?

As of the weekend, PNP officers who have followed Torre’s directives on the revamp remained at their posts, waiting for the final word on the controversy.

Several of those affected belong to the final batches of Philippine Military Academy graduates who were allowed by law to pick the police as their area of service.

Torre leapfrogged past these batches, becoming the first graduate of the PNP Academy to head the police force. Amid the controversy, PNPA Alumni have issued a statement supporting him in the revamp.

The principal concern of the public is that the turf war may affect PNP services. The Marcos administration is already facing criticism for supposedly being soft on criminality compared with his predecessor.

President Marcos may have to step in and provide clear guidelines on this issue, if only to ensure that law enforcement and the maintenance of peace and order will not be affected by the controversy.
