The senior deputy minority leader of the House of Representatives, Edgar Erice, is set to question before the Supreme Court the inclusion of unprogrammed appropriations in the 2026 national budget.

Erice waited for President Marcos to sign into law the 2026 General Appropriations Act yesterday before readying the legal challenge. The President vetoed P92.5 billion in unprogrammed appropriations in the 2026 GAA, but kept P150.9 billion intact.

He also retained all the unconditional ayuda or “soft pork barrel” in the GAA. These include MAIFIP or the Medical Assistance for Indigent and Financially Incapacitated Patients that 72 medical and health care organizations had opposed, the Assistance for Individuals in Crisis Situations, the livelihood program TUPAD and aid schemes for several other sectors.

Acting Budget Secretary Rolando Toledo said the GAA includes a provision that expressly prohibits all forms of “political involvement” in the distribution of state dole-outs.

But there is no specific prohibition on political endorsements for aid access, such as the guarantee letters issued by lawmakers for people seeking medical assistance through MAIFIP.

Toledo said such a prohibition may still have to be worked out with implementing agencies. Among others, these are the Department of Health for MAIFIP, the Department of Labor and Employment for TUPAD and Department of Social Welfare and Development for AICS.

Sherwin Gatchalian, chair of the Senate finance committee, had also said that the DOH could prohibit guarantee letters through its own implementing rules for MAIFIP.

Whether Cabinet members will take the initiative to depoliticize the state-funded aid programs will depend on marching orders from the President. If “political involvement” could be specifically prohibited in the GAA, why couldn’t it be done for guarantee letters and similar political endorsements to access state-funded ayuda?

The DSWD had previously said its rules in fact prohibit political involvement in the distribution of aid – such as physical presence or the display of posters of elective officials at distribution sites. But the past years have shown that either the DSWD failed to enforce its own rules, or else politicians disregarded them, knowing that no sanctions awaited their use of state ayuda for political patronage and personal credit-grabbing.

The situation is similar for the other agencies implementing the other ayuda programs.

There are some improvements in this year’s GAA. Education, as stipulated in the Constitution, gets the highest funding allocation. Public works got a more reasonable budget.

The P60 billion impounded from the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. has been restored, although the P51 billion allotted to MAIFIP should have gone to PhilHealth.

After the scandal over “the most corrupt budget ever” in 2025, anything could be considered an improvement. This year’s GAA is better, although the “soft pork” is a disappointment.
