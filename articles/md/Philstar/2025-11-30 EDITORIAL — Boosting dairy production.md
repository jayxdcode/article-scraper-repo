Philippine population growth has progressively slowed down in the past years. As of the latest studies, however, children under age five still account for nearly a tenth of the population.

Of those children, an estimated 373,000 aged two to four suffer from stunting due to undernourishment, according to the Second Congressional Commission on Education. EDCOM 2 had previously reported that 26.7 percent of Filipino children under age five are stunted.

This problem is not new. The government should have long pushed for greater domestic production of milk, one of the best food supplements for the undernourished children of undernourished mothers.

Wasted and unhealthy mothers rarely produce enough breast milk for their infants. And once the breast milk runs out, the alternative – baby formula – is beyond the budget of impoverished parents.

So it’s good to know that the Department of Agriculture and the National Dairy Authority have launched a stock farm for dairy cattle in Nueva Ecija. The P59-million General Tinio Stock Farm aims to address the shortage of productive dairy cattle in the country and boost the abysmal level of national milk sufficiency, currently at just 2.3 percent.

With a capacity for 150 cattle, the stock farm – the first of five to be inaugurated – will serve as a breeding, development and acclimatization center for imported dairy animals.

Stunting in fact starts at the womb for those belonging to the impoverished, with undernourished mothers unable to give their children the nutrients needed for healthy development even before birth.

Among Filipinos in the two-to-four age group, only 43 percent or 159,000 of the estimated 373,000 suffering from wasting are covered by the supplemental feeding program, EDCOM 2 executive director Karol Mark Yee told the Senate on Nov. 25.

This means about 213,000 children are left out, and they are likely the ones who most need state support in proper nutrition.

For the entire 2025, the government is aiming for a national milk sufficiency of 2.5 percent. That target is too modest for a problem that calls for emergency responses.

But tragically for the country, too many public officials have their power bases anchored on keeping the masses poor and undereducated, and dependent for life on state dole-outs and political patronage. Until this mindset is changed, addressing stunting and boosting domestic milk production will not get the serious attention that they deserve from the government.
