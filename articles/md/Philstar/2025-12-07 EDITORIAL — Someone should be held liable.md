Unconstitutional. Grave abuse of discretion.

Those are the descriptions of the Supreme Court in its ruling promulgated on Dec. 3, which ordered the return of P60 billion to the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. that was impounded by the national government to finance the unprogrammed appropriations in the 2024 General Appropriations Act.

In a unanimous decision, the SC also permanently prohibited the transmittal to the national treasury of another P29.9 billion in supposed unused reserves of PhilHealth. The SC had previously issued a restraining order on the transfer of the amount.

The impounding of supposed savings actually covered not only PhilHealth but all other government-owned and controlled corporations, including the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp., raising concerns about the capability of PDIC and the other GOCCs to carry out their mandate.

GOCC funds were impounded based on a circular issued by then finance secretary Ralph Recto, which implemented a rider or special provision inserted during the bicameral conference on the 2024 General Appropriations Act.

The 2024 GAA featured a surge in the amount of the new congressional pork barrel, the unprogrammed appropriations, which could be financed only if funding sources could be found. The creative minds in Congress then decided to source the funds from GOCCs including PhilHealth and PDIC.

Petitioners who challenged the move argued that the “rider” in the 2024 GAA effectively and unlawfully amended the individual laws that created each GOCC. Taking the “unused funds” of PhilHealth also violated the Universal Healthcare Act, the petitioners argued.

Lawmakers, in a snit over the restraining order that prevented them from using GOCC funds to finance their pork barrel, reduced the PhilHealth subsidy to zero for 2025.

Retired SC senior associate justice Antonio Carpio has said that the transmittal of the initial P60 billion from PhilHealth triggered the release of funds for lawmakers’ flood control projects that were inserted in the unprogrammed appropriations.

While the impounding of the funds was “unconstitutional” and constituted “grave abuse of discretion,” however, the SC ruled that President Marcos, who certified the 2024 GAA as urgent, did not act beyond his authority.

The SC also declined to determine if Recto, now the executive secretary, could be held liable for technical malversation or plunder.

“The issue was never about ‘idle’ funds; it was about funds deliberately made idle at PhilHealth, turned into a pliable ‘fund balance’ ripe for exploitation, wittingly or unwittingly,” the SC ruling written by Associate Justice Amy Lazaro-Javier declared.

That smacks of a criminal act. Perhaps the Office of the Ombudsman can pick up where the SC left off.
