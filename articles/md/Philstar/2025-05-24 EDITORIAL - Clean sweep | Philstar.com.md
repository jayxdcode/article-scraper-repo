The sweeping government revamp, expanded yesterday beyond Cabinet-level positions, is coming on the heels of the sacking of two top officials of the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration on accusations of corruption.

Malacañang said that Arnell Ignacio and Emma Sinclair were removed as OWWA administrator and deputy director, respectively, due to a P1.4-billion acquisition of land for overseas Filipino workers that lacked the approval of the OWWA Board of Trustees, as required by law.

Taints of corruption and other irregularities apart from underperformance will be the gauge in the removal of officials from their posts in the ongoing government reorganization, Palace officials have said.

President Marcos launched what Malacañang has described as a “bold reset” as he acknowledged public dissatisfaction with his government, which was reflected in the outcome of the May 12 elections.

The midterm vote is regarded as a referendum on the current administration. And the outcome of this year’s vote was the worst for any administration in nearly two decades.

Because “unqualified courtesy resignations” were required from all officials from Cabinet level down to bureau chiefs and other officers of the same rank, public expectations are high that the revamp will be sweeping.

Those high public expectations must not be disappointed. As the business community pointed out, the selection of officials must be merit-based. Those appointed mainly for their political support or to please influence-peddling persons or groups, even if they lack the qualifications for the job, have had three years to enjoy their payback and can now be weeded out.

The administration must avoid being seen to be conducting merely a game of musical chairs. It should also avoid reserving spots for losers in the elections, who can accept government appointments only a year after the polls.

Other agencies of government must do their part in promoting transparency and accountability. The nation is still waiting for the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas to release its findings on the ghost employee scandal that led to the resignation of two members of the Monetary Board, V. Bruce Tolentino and Anita Linda Aquino.

The scandal erupted a year ago. How long does it take to conduct a credible probe? Is the BSP sweeping this case under the rug? Lower ranking government employees have been sent to prison for many years for much less. Shouldn’t the bar for exemplary behavior be set higher for BSP members? Are the two enjoying the substantial retirement pensions of Monetary Board members? If they are innocent, they should want their names to be cleared ASAP.

The government has promised a bold reset. If it turns out to be selective and half-baked, perceptions of the administration could become even worse.
