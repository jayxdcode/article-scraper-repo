Those tasked to conduct an impeachment trial have no opt-out clause in Article XI of the Constitution governing accountability and the impeachment of public officials. Instead this section of the 1987 Charter specifically mandates the Senate to act “forthwith” on Articles of Impeachment forwarded to the chamber by at least two-thirds of the House of Representatives.

The Senate received the Articles of Impeachment against Vice President Sara Duterte way back in February. And then senators found every excuse not to begin “forthwith” the impeachment trial, even as they found time to conduct public hearings notably on the arrest of former president Rodrigo Duterte.

Reading of the Articles of Impeachment was supposed to take place upon the resumption of session on June 2. Yet Senate President Francis Escudero, who had refused to convene the chamber as an impeachment court forthwith in February or March, reset this to June 11, just days before the 19th Congress ends its sessions.

With time running out, a resolution is now being circulated, calling for a plenary vote not to proceed with the trial on the grounds that time has run out, the Vice President has been deprived of her right to a speedy trial, and an impeachment trial cannot cross over to a new Congress.

But who deprived the Vice President of the speedy trial in the first place?

The Senate President, who has acted on his own on the chamber’s impeachment calendar, now says refusing to proceed with the trial is a decision of the plenary.

Can the Senate refuse to carry out a constitutional duty?

Those pushing for the trial to proceed point out that trying impeachable officials is a quasi-judicial function outside the main role of the Senate as a legislative body. As in judicial courts, the trial can proceed even if there is a change in the presiding judge – or judges in the case of the Senate. Therefore, this argument goes, Duterte’s trial can officially start in the current Congress and cross over to the incoming 20th.

This point is expected to be challenged before the Supreme Court. But it is not up to senators to speculate on whether such a challenge would be brought to the SC. Their constitutional duty is to proceed with the trial, even if the provision that it should have been done forthwith has already been breached.

Failure to do so can be construed as a dereliction of duty, which can set an ugly precedent in efforts to remove incumbent public officials accused of high crimes and betrayal of public trust. Senators of the 19th Congress should consider if they want to be remembered for setting that precedent.
