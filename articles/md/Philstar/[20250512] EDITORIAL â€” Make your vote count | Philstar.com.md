In free societies, elections are the ultimate expressions of the power of the people. Voting is both a right and a privilege, and the outcome can lead to a better life. It can spell the difference between national progress and stagnation.

In the Philippines, unfortunately, the vote has been undermined by selfish interests, compounded by poverty and undereducation. Political dynasties, with their family fortunes anchored on their influence in government, thrive on keeping the people poor, lacking in education and perpetually dependent on state-funded aid doled out in self-promotion by politicians.

Such candidates dominate the current national and local races today. There are a few bright spots, where candidates who deserve to be called public servants appear headed for victory. But for many of the races, the likely winners are those who put public interest last in their order of priorities.

It will take time and a significant investment in public education to confront this problem, which has been aggravated by the spread of disinformation facilitated by digital technology. The threat of foreign interference in today’s elections, with enormous resources deployed, cannot be completely dismissed.

The final days before the vote saw a surge in vote buying, according to the Commission on Elections. This is expected to continue today, and must be minimized if not completely stopped. The Comelec must see to it that those who are caught are prosecuted and punished. The Philippine National Police is not a passive bystander here; the Comelec has told the PNP to carry out even warrantless arrests.

Citizens can do their part by being vigilant and alerting authorities about possible violations of fair campaign laws. Financing institutions supervised by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas must carry out the BSP order to be on the lookout for possible cases of vote buying as well as money laundering.

There are people despairing over the results of pre-election surveys. But even if the situation looks hopeless, it is good to vote one’s conscience. Voters can express disapproval of candidates who are leading because of sheer name recall or money politics. People can make it a protest vote.

Make your vote count.
