By an overwhelming plenary vote of 284 in favor, with only eight against and four abstaining, the House of Representatives junked yesterday the two impeachment complaints against President Marcos.

The plenary adopted Resolution 746, with the House committee on justice recommending the junking of the impeachment complaints based on insufficiency of substance. The panel had deliberated on the complaints for three session days.

Impeachment is a political process, and the dismissal of the complaints by the pro-administration super majority was not unexpected. Last week, Malacañang had welcomed the junking of the complaints at the committee level, also by an overwhelming vote. The dismissal effectively shields the President for a year from the initiation of another impeachment effort.

But the Palace should also acknowledge the comments of the handful who opposed the speedy dismissal of the complaints, particularly the second one, which sought to hold the President accountable for three specific issues: the authorization of unprogrammed appropriations in the annual national budget; the creation of a formula that institutionalized district infrastructure allocations, and his alleged role in budgeting schemes that allowed kickbacks.

“Public doubt does not disappear when we refuse to examine it,” said ML party-list Rep. Leila de Lima. “It stays, it lingers, it hardens, and it becomes part of political memory.”

The dismissal is final, but such doubts will complicate moving on, as called for by Malacañang.

The President can ease doubts about his commitment to transparency and accountability by pushing for structural reforms that will decisively put an end to budgeting schemes that allow public officials to steal public funds and use state resources for their self-promotion.

He can also revive the momentum of his anti-corruption crackdown, which is now perceived to have stalled due to political realities and his family ties. Among other things, the resulting uncertainty has raised fears that the country could find itself back on the gray list of countries under close monitoring for money laundering by the Financial Action Task Force.

Last week, after the House committee tossed out the impeachment complaints, President Marcos said he was happy to be free of “distractions.” Beyond his gratitude for the dismissal, he should focus on reforms, and prod investigators and state prosecutors to pursue corrupt officials relentlessly and swiftly, sparing no sacred cows.
