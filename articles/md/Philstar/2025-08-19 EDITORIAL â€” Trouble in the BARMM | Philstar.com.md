Much hope is being pinned on the first-ever parliamentary elections set on Oct. 13 in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. But it seems trouble is always on the horizon for the Bangsamoro.

With less than two months before the BARMM polls, Moro Islamic Liberation Front chairman Ahod “Al Haj Murad” Ebrahim has ordered MILF members to suspend participation in all decommissioning activities of the government. What this means is that they will be holding on to their guns during an election period in one of the most violence-prone regions in the country.

The national government must intervene decisively, before this spark of discontent turns into a conflagration that compromises the still fragile peace in the BARMM.

There are suspicions that the unrest could be connected to Ebrahim’s replacement in March this year as BARMM chief minister by Maguindanao del Norte Gov. Abdulrauf Macacua.

No reason was given by Malacañang for the replacement of Ebrahim, whose group signed a peace deal with the government in March 2014. But the MILF later said Ebrahim had resigned to focus on his campaign for the BARMM polls as candidate of the group’s United Bangsamoro Justice Party.

Macacua served as chief of staff of the MILF’s Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces, and was part of the 80-member Bangsamoro Transition Authority created in 2019 when Ebrahim began serving as BARMM chief minister. Ebrahim picked Macacua as the BARMM environment minister and senior minister before President Marcos appointed Macacua as governor of the newly created Maguindanao del Norte.

The BARMM vote, originally scheduled to coincide with the midterm elections last May, was reset to October, ostensibly to adjust to a Supreme Court ruling in September last year declaring that Sulu is not part of the autonomous region.

With the start of the election period on Aug. 14, a gun ban is in place in the BARMM. On Aug. 16, however, the MILF central committee headed by Ebrahim ordered all of the group’s members, commanders, fronts, agencies and their representatives not to participate in any decommissioning or normalization activities unilaterally organized by the national government and the Office of the Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unity or OPAPRU.

This order was based on a resolution of the MILF central committee last July 19, suspending the fourth and final phase of the decommissioning – the process under which MILF combatants lay down their arms. The reason given was ostensibly the inadequate benefits granted to the 26,000 combatants who have participated so far in the decommissioning – a charge denied by the OPAPRU.

The issue must be settled before the election campaign heats up. The stakes are high for ensuring the credibility of the BARMM vote.
