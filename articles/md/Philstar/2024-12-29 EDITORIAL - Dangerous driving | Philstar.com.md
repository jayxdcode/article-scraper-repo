Earlier this month, a wing van truck smashed into several vehicles along the Katipunan flyover in Quezon City, leaving four people dead and at least 25 others injured. The truck driver said the wing van lost its brakes – a common problem in many fatal accidents, especially those involving trucks and passenger buses.

Last Friday, the Land Transportation Office announced that it was imposing a 90-day preventive suspension of the registration of the truck. The LTO announced the order after its investigation of the Dec. 5 accident showed several problems related to roadworthiness.

Between 2021 and 2023, the wing van had been apprehended multiple times for overloading, LTO officials said, adding that this could weaken the truck’s brakes. “This established the fact that the subject vehicle is unfit to be operated,” LTO chief Vigor Mendoza said. The registered engine number of the truck was also found to be different from what was recorded in the findings of a vehicle inspection team, Mendoza added. He said the LTO was studying the possible liability of the truck owner not only for roadworthiness problems involving the vehicle but also for employing a reckless driver.

How many other vehicles plying the country’s roads have similar problems? The question comes to mind amid reports that from Dec. 22 to 27 alone, the Department of Health had recorded 284 road accidents at eight pilot sites chosen by the DOH for its “BiyaHealthy” campaign for a safe holiday celebration.

Apart from vehicle roadworthiness issues, drivers themselves can be blamed directly for numerous accidents and injuries. Of the 284 accidents, the DOH reported that 53 drivers were found to be under the influence of alcohol. Of 196 accidents involving motorcycles, 249 riders and their passengers did not use safety accessories such as helmets, the DOH reported.

Driving requires full control of one’s physical and mental faculties. This control is not possible under the influence of alcohol or drugs, when one is drowsy from fatigue or lack of sleep, or distracted by gadgets such as cell phones. This puts not only the driver but other people at grave risk, with loss of life and damage to property likely. Authorities will have to do more to promote safe, defensive driving using roadworthy vehicles.
