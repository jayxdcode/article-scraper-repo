Amid concerns over the spread of mpox, the Department of Health is calling for the declaration of a national public health emergency – not for mpox, but for human immunodeficiency virus infections.

HIV cases have surged by 500 percent in the first quarter of the year from the same period in 2024, the DOH said, with an average of 57 cases being confirmed daily and infections highest among young adults. This is the highest in the Western Pacific region, according to the DOH.

In previous years, the World Health Organization had flagged the Philippines for having the fastest rate of HIV infection in the Western Pacific. UNAIDS epidemiological estimates in 2023 showed that from 2010 to 2022, the chance of new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths in the Philippines stood at 418 percent and 535 percent, respectively.

Despite laws passed in the Philippines in recent years promoting access to HIV-AIDS treatment, only about 64 percent of the 122,255 people living with HIV in the country as of March 2024 were on antiretroviral therapy.

At current infection trends, health experts are projecting that by 2030, the number of Filipinos living with HIV/AIDS would be at 401,700, or more than double the number as of end-2023.

Studies have attributed the rate of infections to continuing stigma attached to people living with HIV, which can hinder testing, management and treatment. The use of contraceptives and condoms for safe sex is also low, according to studies, while efforts to fully implement sex education face roadblocks.

At the same time, the studies show that casual sexual encounters and other risky sexual behaviors are facilitated by online dating sites or apps.

The DOH has stressed that HIV infection is more alarming than the detection of mpox cases in several areas in the country. Mpox is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, which makes people engaging in casual sex at high risk.

Apart from seeking the declaration of a state of national public health emergency, the DOH is urging people to get HIV tests, noting that these are free and confidential. It is also pushing for the use of condoms, lubricants and pre-exposure prophylactic measures to prevent HIV infection.

Both HIV and mpox can lead to death, but this can be prevented with early diagnosis, management and treatment. Infection itself can be avoided, by heeding the advice of health experts.
