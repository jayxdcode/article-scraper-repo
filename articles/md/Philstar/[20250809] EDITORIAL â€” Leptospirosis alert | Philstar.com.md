A tropical storm could intensify into a typhoon this Sunday or Monday, according to state meteorologists. Health experts are reminding the public about the dangers of exposure to contaminated floodwaters that may cause leptospirosis.

In just the first five days of August, seven deaths attributed to leptospirosis have been recorded at the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila. SLH personnel said all seven had waded through the floods that forced the suspension of classes and government work for an entire week in Metro Manila and other parts of Luzon.

There were 45 leptospirosis cases as of Aug. 5 in San Lazaro alone, 15 of them minors. The head of the SLH medical center said leptospirosis cases appeared to be more aggressive this season, with serious complications occurring within two to seven days.

All the 45 cases had such complications affecting the kidney, liver, lungs or the respiratory system, which required putting them on ventilators. Doctors noted that a number of the patients were motorcycle riders who passed through flooded streets without protection for blisters on their feet.

These cases should serve as urgent warnings to the public about the need to be mindful of the risks posed by leptospirosis. The bacterial infection can develop from exposure to water, soil, vegetation and surfaces that have been contaminated by the urine of infected animals, particularly rats, which are the primary carriers of the Leptospira bacteria.

Leptospira enters the body through skin abrasions or cuts as well as through the eyes, nose or mouth, so people are advised to wear waterproof protective footwear and clothing when wading through floodwaters.

This year, the Department of Health has recorded 3,037 leptospirosis cases from Jan. 1 to July 19, with 1,114 of the cases logged since June 8 alone – a week after the weather bureau declared the official start of the rainy season. From July 13 to 31, DOH-run hospitals recorded 569 cases.

Health experts are encouraging people who have waded through floods to monitor themselves for symptoms such as high fever and chills, headache, muscle pain notably in the lower back and calves, red eyes, vomiting, diarrhea, yellowing of the skin and eyes and dark-colored urine. The symptoms can occur within five to seven days after exposure.

A prescription drug can be taken as a prophylaxis. If left untreated, leptospirosis can lead to kidney or liver failure, meningitis, respiratory distress and death. The health warning cannot be ignored.
