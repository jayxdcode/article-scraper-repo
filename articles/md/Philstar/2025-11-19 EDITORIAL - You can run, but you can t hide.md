As promised, the first criminal cases in connection with the flood control scandal were filed in court yesterday by the Office of the Ombudsman.

Included in the first batch of defendants is Elizaldy Co, who opted to resign as Ako Bicol party-list congressman rather than face the serious graft-related accusations that could put him away for life, if guilt is established.

With his indictment before the anti-graft court Sandiganbayan, an arrest warrant is expected to be issued soon for Co and his passport canceled. If he is holed out in a country without an extradition treaty with the Philippines, the arrest warrant can be coursed through the Interpol.

This eliminates the possibility of Co swearing under oath, in a Philippine diplomatic mission wherever he is overseas, to the veracity of the statements he read in videos he posted online recently.

The largely self-serving statements effectively exculpated Co of prime responsibility in the mangling of the national budget so he could earn kickbacks from flood control projects inserted in the outlay when he chaired the House committee on appropriations.

Legal experts have stressed that the accusations Co hurled in the videos need to be sworn to and authenticated, and then subjected to closer scrutiny before formal charges can be brought against those he has implicated in alleged multibillion-peso kickbacks.

Co, however, has claimed that he refuses to return to the country because of death threats not only against him but also against his aides. If the threats are real, he might have been allowed to swear to the veracity of his videotaped statements before authorized officials in a Philippine diplomatic mission overseas.

But this option has quickly closed, with a warrant expected soon for his arrest, which the government can course through the Interpol, and which can be enforced if Co steps into a Philippine consulate.

As the cases of expelled Negros Oriental congressman Arnolfo Teves Jr. and former Bamban mayor Alice Guo showed, the world has become a smaller place for those who break the law.

For someone claiming innocence, it would have been better to return to the country voluntarily and face the charges squarely, to clear one’s name ASAP.

Instead Co will have to find out the hard way that you can run, but you can’t hide. And one day soon, you will be flown back to the country, handcuffed to a plane seat throughout the ride.
