Just to bring home further the decline in the quality of education, the Philippines ranked 74th out of 177 countries and economies in the Global Education Futures Readiness Index.

GEFRI, drawn up by US-based global research and innovation consultancy Education Futures LLC, is an open, interactive tool for measuring a country’s preparedness for meeting the challenges and opportunities provided by education in a rapidly evolving global environment.

The rankings enable users to compare countries and economies according to the latest data on human capital, innovation, infrastructure, governance and equitable access to education.

Scoring 56.32 out of 100, the Philippines was categorized among countries with “emerging or partial readiness,” meaning they “may be making important advances, but continue to face persistent structural or systemic barriers.”

The innovation indicator includes national investment in research and development and high-tech exports. Infrastructure includes internet connectivity, access to electricity, secure digital services and mobile communication.

Human capital tracks government investment in education, literacy rates and public participation in secondary and higher level schooling, support for lifelong learning and workforce adaptability.

The governance dimension assesses the efficiency of public institutions, quality of regulation, accountability and control of corruption. School access covers the inclusiveness of education, with special focus on gender parity and out-of-school rates.

While placing 74th out of 177 may not seem too bad, the rank is dismaying when compared to those of other states and economies in the region.

The Philippines ranked behind South Korea (3rd place overall), Hong Kong (6th), Japan (10th), China (45th), Mongolia (63rd) and Macau (67th).

Among Southeast Asian nations, the Philippines trailed perennial achiever Singapore (4th overall), Thailand (48th), Malaysia (49th), Brunei (57th), Indonesia (61st) and Vietnam (70th). The Philippines was ahead only of Timor-Leste (106th), Cambodia (126th), Myanmar (131st) and Laos (136th).

On its site, GEFRI states that it is designed “to help policymakers, educators, researchers and advocates explore patterns, identify strengths and gaps, and spark new conversations about the future of education worldwide.”

The rankings tend to reflect levels of economic development in Southeast Asia, where the Philippines has progressively fallen behind. This latest assessment should provide additional impetus for policy-makers to intensify efforts to address the crisis in Philippine education and make the country future-ready.
