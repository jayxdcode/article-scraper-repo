Even before the 20th Congress has opened, an entertainer-turned-politician has promised to push for a legislated wage increase.

The promise was given after the two chambers of the 19th Congress failed to agree on the amount of the wage hike that they wanted to pass, without consulting the sector that is supposed to pay the increase. The Senate proposed an increase of P100. Not to be outdone, the House of Representatives trumpeted a hike of P200.

Both chambers did not bother consulting the investment community, whose leaders pointed out that legislating wages willy-nilly without bothering to determine the capability of businesses to comply with the hike would hit hard the small enterprises, which account for over 90 percent of business operations in this country.

This, the business community warned, could lead to layoffs and shutdowns, which would negate the promised benefits to workers. Politicizing wage fixing will also add to the many disincentives that have made the country a regional laggard in job-generating investments. Already, the country is losing out to its neighbors in attracting major investors who are decamping from China amid geopolitical and other issues.

Instead of populist posturing on politicized wage fixing and tax-funded subsidies, the focus should be on creating meaningful employment. Public officials should concentrate on generating jobs by providing the kind of environment that can compete with the country’s neighbors in attracting investments.

Such an environment calls for ease of doing business – an area where the country continues to lag behind its neighbors, despite the passage of two laws related to facilitating doing business and cutting red tape.

Among the biggest hindrances to the proper implementation of the two laws, as all major business groups have often pointed out, are local government units and barangay offices. The latest proponent of the legislated wage hike should tell this to his relatives, who are LGU executives.

By creating more jobs with decent pay, working overseas will no longer be a necessity, but simply one of the numerous options for the Filipino workforce.

Instead of slashing billions from the education and health budgets for realignment to the congressional pork barrel, lawmakers should focus on raising the quality of education, to allow the country’s workforce to face the challenges of a global order that is being shaken up dramatically by AI-enabled work environments.

Increasing funding for education and the other critical component of human development, public health, would be helped by drastically cutting corruption.

A good start would be for the proponent of the revival of a legislated wage hike to ask his father to return to public coffers P124.5 million from the pork barrel scandal, as ordered by a court.
