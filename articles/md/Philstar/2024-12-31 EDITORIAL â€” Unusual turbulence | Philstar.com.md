From politics to the weather, the year that’s about to pass has been full of unusual turbulence. In 2024, the rift in the UniTeam and the Marcos and Duterte clans erupted into full-blown warfare. Consequently, Vice President Sara Duterte quit as education secretary, lost P1.3 billion in office funds, and ranted about having President Marcos assassinated in case she is killed. She is now bracing for efforts to oust her through impeachment in the early part of 2025.

Her father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, may face indictment for crimes against humanity in connection with the thousands killed in his war on drugs – either in the Philippines, or before the International Criminal Court, if the Marcos administration decides to hand him over to the ICC through the Interpol.

Inquiries conducted by the House quad committee exposed the other horrific abuses that accompanied the bloody war on drugs, from large-scale corruption to summary executions not only of drug dealers but also of those who crossed Duterte’s minions such as Royina Garma.

Fake birth certificates, cyberscams and other criminal activities linked to Philippine offshore gaming operations finally led the Marcos administration to order a total ban on POGOs and their local version, the internet gaming licensees.

For ordinary Filipinos, high prices and job opportunities remained the top concerns during the year. Rice prices refused to go down despite a hefty tariff cut that was meant to flood the country with imports. With rice at P20 a kilo looking ever more remote, the agriculture chief said the sector was hit this year by a “perfect storm” of El Niño, La Niña, powerful cyclones and pestilence.

The year had its moments of triumph, led by gymnast Carlos Yulo who brought home not just one but two Olympic gold medals. But bad news prevailed, with extreme weather causing catastrophic flooding even in places unused to such calamities. Severe Tropical Storm Kristine alone left 160 people dead and nearly 10 million affected.

This much is clear, especially to those who are dismayed by the budget priorities of senators and congressmen: the incoming year is posing stiff challenges. Responding to them efficiently will be affected by the hefty funding cuts in 2025 for frontline services including health, education, agriculture and social welfare.

Last week, pollster Social Weather Stations Inc. released the results of its traditional yearend survey, which showed the number of Filipinos greeting the New Year with hope at a 15-year low. Although the figure was still high at 90 percent, it was a six-point drop from the previous year’s 96 percent, and the lowest since the 89 percent in 2009. The numbers, however, can improve, with proper responses in the coming year.
