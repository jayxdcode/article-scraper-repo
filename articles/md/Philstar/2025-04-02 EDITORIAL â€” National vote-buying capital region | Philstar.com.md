The Commission on Elections hesitates to call it the vote-buying capital of the country, but Metro Manila has consistently topped all regions in the number of vote-buying cases, according to Comelec officials.

Several possible reasons for this have been raised. Among these is that the National Capital Region is the most densely populated region and accounts for a hefty 31.2 percent of gross domestic product – the largest – which also makes it the wealthiest in the country.

But the NCR, despite accounting for the largest contribution to GDP, also has a large number of people living below the poverty line, who are the most vulnerable to the buy-and-sell of votes.

Another possible reason is that there is high public awareness in the NCR of election rules and offenses, and greater civic responsibility to report offenders.

Regardless of the reason, if vote buying is rampant in the NCR, the region can also serve as a model in efforts to clamp down on the vote buyers.

Digital technology allows the public to record possible vote buying activities. The Comelec must carry out an extensive information campaign instructing the public about prohibited acts that can be documented on cell phone cameras, and how to alert the poll body about the illegal activities. Most people would want anonymity in reporting, so the Comelec must provide the mechanics for this.

At the same time, the Comelec must ensure that it will act swiftly on the information and go after suspected vote buyers. Comelec hotlines and dedicated email addresses for reporting possible violations must be widely disseminated.

The Comelec is also working with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and e-wallet service providers to clamp down on the movement of large amounts of cash particularly in the week before election day, when vote buying is most rampant. There are people who are skeptical that the initiative will amount to anything. The Comelec must show that the skepticism is unfounded.

Beyond reporting vote-buying statistics, the Comelec and its partners must move to stop this form of poll fraud and prosecute the perpetrators.
