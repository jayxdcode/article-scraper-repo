State meteorologists have officially declared the start of the rainy season. The public can only hope that government officials were not too preoccupied with the just concluded midterm elections and have prepared for the rains and floods.

At least two tropical cyclones are expected to hit the country this month, according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration. There are detailed geohazard maps of areas vulnerable to mudslides and heavy flooding. Local government units must prepare for emergency evacuation in these areas and must carefully monitor not just PAGASA advisories on approaching cyclones but also the color-coded rainfall alerts.

Decent evacuation facilities must be readied and presented to the public, to encourage timely evacuation in case disaster strikes. Many people refuse to leave their homes during natural calamities because they don’t like evacuation facilities. They also fear that their houses might be burglarized in their absence, and they worry about their pets and backyard livestock such as pigs and chickens. Evacuation plans must factor in accommodations for pets, as well as separate pens for livestock.

Evacuation facilities must also be coordinated with health services. Diseases quickly spread in crowded evacuation sites with inadequate clean water and sanitation facilities, with children and the elderly among the most vulnerable to illness.

In Metro Manila and other urban centers, flooding must be mitigated. It’s just the start of the season, so for those who failed to do their homework because they concentrated on the election campaign during the long, hot Philippine summer, there’s still time to clean up waterways and drainage systems.

Canals and other waterways must be cleared of shanties, for the informal settlers’ own safety during torrential rainfall and floods. Extreme weather has become more common amid climate change, and the country has increasingly seen unusually heavy rainfall that swells waterways so rapidly people have little time to respond properly to the cataclysmic flooding.

The school year begins on June 16. With the rains come the mosquitoes, and all the pathogens that the insects bring including the dengue virus. Children and education personnel must be protected from dengue by ensuring that classrooms and school grounds are clean, free of standing water and properly ventilated.

PAGASA has announced that the rainy season is here. With the official declaration, there is no excuse to be poorly prepared.
