Brushing aside concerns over possible fund misuse, President Marcos retained the allocation inserted by Congress in the 2025 national budget for the Ayuda para sa Kapos ang Kita Program. AKAP, administered by the Department of Social Welfare and Development, duplicates the functions of another DSWD-run unconditional cash dole-out, the AICS or Assistance for Individuals in Crisis Situations.

AKAP became controversial after it was linked to the ill-advised signature campaign to amend the Constitution. DSWD officials have been saying for several months now that politicians have no say in AKAP distribution. Photos and video footage of payout events for both AKAP and AICS, however, almost always include politicians, from the Vice President to senators and congressmen to local government and barangay officials.

Sen. Grace Poe, chair of the Senate committee on finance, reinforced public perceptions that the DSWD’s cash aid programs are used for political purposes when she announced that for 2025, members of the House of Representatives have a share of P21 billion in AKAP appropriations while senators get P5 billion.

Amid criticisms that the 2025 national outlay is geared to make taxpayers pay for the election campaigns of the administration’s political allies, Malacañang announced that AKAP disbursements would be “conditional” and would have a layer of oversight, courtesy of the Department of Labor and Employment and the National Economic and Development Authority. The Department of Budget and Management also stressed that all aid or ayuda fund releases must comply with DBM guidelines. Yet doubts persist on the use of AKAP and AICS for political purposes.

As the DOLE and NEDA worked with the DSWD on the rules for AKAP distribution, Social Welfare Secretary Rex Gatchalian announced yesterday that the guidelines include a ban on candidates showing up at AKAP payout areas. He should include AICS payout and related events. DSWD personnel who do their job and follow the guidelines must also be protected from any form of harassment or retaliation by politicians who are driven away from the ayuda distribution activities.

This ban on epal politicians is a welcome move, and taxpayers should not be disappointed in its implementation. The administration should go one step further and expand the AKAP-related ban beyond the campaign period. The guidelines should also include a ban on politicians’ display anywhere in the country of any material claiming credit for any DSWD aid program. No public official should take personal credit for any project or program funded with people’s money.
