With the rains and floods come the mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit including dengue. Even before the onset of the rainy season, however, the Department of Health had already logged over 110,000 dengue cases nationwide from the start of the year until May 10. This was a surge of 224 percent compared to the cases during the same period last year, the DOH said.

Of the 110,000 cases, there were 437 deaths, mostly children aged five to nine. Last February, the DOH launched the “Alas-Kwatro Kontra Mosquito” campaign. It encourages the public to ensure that surroundings are clean and free of stagnant water or damp spots where the dengue vector Aedes aegypti mosquito can breed.

Apart from the cleanup drive, people are encouraged to wear insect repellent and protective clothing. Houses are encouraged to have screens. Those residing in dwellings without such screens are encouraged to protect themselves with mosquito nets when sleeping.

At the same time, there are people waiting for the second-generation dengue vaccine Qdenga to become available in the Philippines. Qdenga maker Takeda Pharmaceuticals of Japan has announced that it has submitted all information required by the DOH for approval of the dengue vaccine, which is now available in about 40 countries in South America, Asia and Europe – mostly places where dengue is endemic such as Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.

Brazil, which has faced one of its worst dengue epidemics, has ordered about six million doses of Qdenga, which was pre-qualified by the World Health Organization in May 2024 as a vaccine for dengue fever. The WHO recommended Qdenga for children aged six to 16, although Takeda recommends its use for people aged four and older, which is being done in Brazil and Vietnam.

Qdenga or TAK-003, unlike the controversial Dengvaxia of Sanofi-Pasteur, can be administered safely to people whether or not they have a previous history of dengue. It is administered in two doses three months apart.

The DOH deferred approval of Qdenga after Takeda voluntarily withdrew its applications in the United States and Singapore pending compliance with those countries’ regulatory requirements on aspects of data collection for the vaccine. Takeda said it had provided the DOH with the explanation for the voluntary pullout, and submitted the risk management plan required by the department. The company is now waiting for the final nod from the Food and Drug Administration.

If the DOH is still worried about a repeat of the hysteria that surrounded Dengvaxia, it can initially allow the commercial rollout of Qdenga once it is satisfied that Takeda has met the requirements. There are Filipinos who have been waiting for the vaccine to become available in the country and are willing to pay for their shots. The government must facilitate access to every protection against dengue.
