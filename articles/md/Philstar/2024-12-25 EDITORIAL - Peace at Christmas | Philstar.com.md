Peace on Earth, good will to men – how elusive these can be, in many parts of the world. And yet, at least once a year, Christians gather together in a spirit of joy, sharing their blessings not only with loved ones and friends but also with the less fortunate.

Political turbulence has not dampened the celebration of Christmas in Asia’s bastion of the Roman Catholic faith. Filipinos take pride in having the longest Christmas season in the world, with holiday décor being put on display and Christmas carols being played in shopping malls as early as September, the start of the so-called ’ber months.

For those who are blessed enough to enjoy peace, the good will of the season can be shared. Those with limited material resources are sharing their energy and enthusiasm, assisting in programs for the welfare of children, the elderly, persons with disabilities, battered women, those of poor physical and mental health, and the millions who need to scrounge for food to put on the Christmas table.

It’s too much to expect political opponents to make peace this Yuletide, or to unite as a nation, as a top official urged in his Christmas message. But there can be a verbal ceasefire among political opponents in this season of joy.

This year for the first time, the military has refused to observe a holiday truce with communist rebels. Even in the absence of unilateral ceasefire declarations, however, both sides can still take a break from armed violence to enjoy downtime with loved ones and friends.

In a world of turmoil, moments of peace are possible; peace and goodwill need not be luxuries in life.

A blessed, peaceful Christmas to all!
