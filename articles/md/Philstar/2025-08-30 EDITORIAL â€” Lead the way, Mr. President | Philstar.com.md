After nearly a decade, amid mounting public outrage over the systematic theft of trillions of pesos meant for critical infrastructure, people might again get to scrutinize the official asset declarations of government officials.

Yesterday, Malacañang announced that President Marcos is willing to lead by example and undergo a lifestyle check. Not only that, the Palace said he is also ready to release his official statement of assets, liabilities and net worth.

SALNs are supposed to be public documents. Republic Act 6713, the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees, states under Section 8: “Public officials and employees have an obligation to accomplish and submit declarations under oath of, and the public has the right to know, their assets, liabilities, net worth and financial and business interests including those of their spouses and of unmarried children under eighteen (18) years of age living in their households.”

RA 6713 provides that the SALNs shall be made available for inspection “at reasonable hours,” and “available to the public” up to 10 years upon filing. The only requirement from “any person requesting a copy of a statement” is the payment of “a reasonable fee to cover the cost of reproduction and mailing of such statement, as well as the cost of certification.”

Yet these provisions were set aside when Samuel Martires was named ombudsman during the Duterte administration. Martires – to the delight of thieves in government – kept a tight watch on the SALNs, keeping them away particularly from nosy journalists, and dismissed as “illogical” lifestyle checks.

President Marcos is set to pick a replacement for Martires. But the President need not wait for a new ombudsman. Martires’ order did not stop public officials from voluntarily releasing their SALNs. Only Leni Robredo, however, did so during her vice presidency.

This time, President Marcos can give his campaign for transparency a major boost by leading in the release of his SALN, and subjecting himself to a lifestyle check.
