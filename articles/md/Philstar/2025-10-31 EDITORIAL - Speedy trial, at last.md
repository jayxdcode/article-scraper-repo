In line with constitutional provisions, the 10th Congress passed in February 1998 Republic Act 8493, the Speedy Trial Act. In subsequent years, the Supreme Court also issued several rules to speed up trials throughout the judiciary.

And yet here we are, nearly 28 years after RA 8493 was enacted, now in the 20th Congress, with the Philippine judicial system still notorious for its glacial pace.

The slow delivery of government services typically encourages the payment of “facilitation fees” or grease money. It’s not surprising that the Philippine judiciary also merited special mention for corruption in the latest country report of the US State Department.

Aggravating the snail’s pace is its use by crooks to seek the dismissal of the charges against them, by invoking their constitutional right to a speedy trial and citing the “inordinate delay” in the legal proceedings.

The scariest thought in this season for remembering the dead is the possibility that after all the hue and cry about corruption involving several high public officials and wealthy businessmen, everyone will get off with hardly a slap on the wrist, thanks to a compromised justice system.

To dispel this terrifying prospect – and in response to unrelenting public outrage – the Sandiganbayan has promised speedy trial of cases to be filed in connection with the flood control and other infrastructure anomalies. The anti-graft court is reportedly drafting new rules to fast-track the trials and ensure their resolution within six to eight months.

Any conviction is automatically appealable. Similar commitments to speedy trial should also be publicly made by the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.

The SC itself has announced that once the criminal indictments reach the courts, it would designate special courts to exclusively handle the cases related to the still widening corruption scandal.

This would be in line with the SC’s Strategic Plan for Judicial Innovations, which aims to enhance efficiency, transparency and accountability across the judiciary, from the trial courts to the Sandiganbayan, the Court of Appeals and Court of Tax Appeals.

The nation has heard such commitments before. Simply enforcing the Speedy Trial Act, and enforcing penalties on violators, would help dispel fears that going after the crooks implicated in the infrastructure mess would eventually prove to be an exercise in futility.
