Within just over a week of each other, leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives have been replaced, becoming the most prominent casualties so far of public fury over colossal corruption in flood control projects and the budget process.

But private contractors, public works officials and many other politicians have also been implicated, with more names emerging every week. The ongoing probes are unearthing the dismaying depth of corruption at all levels of government.

The corruption is estimated to have cost taxpayers trillions that went to the pockets of thieves in government and their accomplices in the private sector.

Crooks systematically enriched themselves on the backs of grievous public misery. Substandard and non-existent public works projects have caused deaths and serious illness, destroyed private property and livelihoods as well as crops and public infrastructure, displaced thousands and caused regular disruptions in work and classes.

Today, Filipinos from multiple sectors will take to the streets in protest, in what has been dubbed the Trillion Peso March.

It is being held on the 53rd anniversary of the declaration of martial law by Ferdinand Marcos, whose conjugal dictatorship with his wife Imelda would also gain notoriety for kleptocracy and gross human rights violations.

It is a national tragedy that the abuses of the authoritarian regime persisted even after the restoration of democracy in 1986.

Today the only son and namesake of the dictator is moving to rehabilitate the family name, among other things by curbing rights abuses and spearheading efforts to excise the rot of corruption.

Beyond shaming thieves, naming names and exposing the rot, people want to see criminals punished. Not surprisingly, many of those implicated in the current scandals are denying culpability. Filipinos know only too well that the road to justice in this country can be so long and tortuous that it gives the courts an excuse to dismiss criminal cases due to “inordinate delay.”

Public anger over the flood control mess has risen to the extent that people are calling for capital punishment for those responsible, with drowning as the mode of execution.

Such calls have prompted Church leaders and government authorities to urge people to vent their rage through peaceful means. Organizers of today’s rallies have given assurance that the mass actions will be peaceful. They are in fact on alert for groups that might sabotage the protests by sparking violence.

The nation is now seeing clearly the consequences of corruption. It is criminal. It is evil that must be vanquished. Public rage must be expressed, and sustained.
