With the reforms in the budget process, authorities should listen to the experts and review the approach to flood control.

Scientists and engineers who are not engaged in pocketing public funds have stressed the need for a more science-based and integrated approach in water management.

That’s right – it’s water management, which means harvesting rainwater alongside tapping fresh water resources, and redirecting or treating the water for useful purposes, from household and industrial use to agriculture and other human activities.

People can start by making use of geohazard maps, including detailed maps of the flood-prone areas in Metro Manila and other areas. The maps were drawn up years ago under Project NOAH, or the Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards.

NOAH is a disaster risk reduction and management program, which was administered by the Department of Science and Technology from 2012 to 2017, and which is now managed by the University of the Philippines.

Geologist Mahar Lagmay, executive director of Project NOAH, is urging the public to access the maps detailing the flood-prone streets in Mega Manila, if only to avoid getting trapped in flash floods during thunderstorms.

Such geohazard maps have been available for years, but have largely been ignored, whether in preparing for typhoons, storm surges or earthquakes.

The flood maps can also help in designing appropriate interventions, according to Lagmay, who lamented the emphasis on the use of concrete for flood mitigation. Often, he pointed out, concrete interventions aggravated flooding by covering natural water catchments, making waterways narrower and shallower and blocking the passages for floodwater.

Lagmay is encouraging the installation of cisterns to catch and store rainwater for recycling while at the same time minimizing flooding.

The two water concessionaries in Metro Manila can lead the way in the use of cisterns and other rainwater retention facilities. Commercial and industrial buildings can also install such facilities for water recycling, or at least to help in flood mitigation. In agricultural areas, large water impounding facilities can be used for irrigation and livestock farm needs.

Lagmay pointed out that even households can have rudimentary cisterns to catch and store rainwater, which can be used for watering plants, for example, or cleaning driveways and cars.

With extreme weather becoming the new normal, and with the government seeking new directions in flood mitigation, it will be useful to listen to the scientists.
