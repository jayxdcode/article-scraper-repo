The nation commemorates Araw ng Kagitingan today as China continues trespassing into Philippine sovereign waters and the two countries exchange accusations of espionage.

On this special day, members of the Philippine Coast Guard and the Philippine Navy deserve commendation for their valor in standing up to Chinese bullying in the West Philippine Sea, and for protecting Filipinos’ right to fish within the country’s 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone as defined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Both the Philippines and China are signatories to UNCLOS.

During the pandemic, health professionals merited special mention on the Day of Valor for being on the frontlines of a deadly battle that claimed millions of lives worldwide and took a long time to be won. The health frontliners continue to deserve commendation as everyday heroes. So do teachers, most of whom are overworked and underpaid, as well as the other people in government who give justice to the term public servants.

Apart from dedicated government workers and those who are carrying out their duty of protecting Philippine sovereignty and maritime economic entitlements, ordinary Filipinos can mark the Day of Valor in other ways.

One is by calling out or standing up to those who commit wrongdoing, from infractions to major offenses. Ordinary civil servants can be on the lookout for the misuse of public funds and can help document wrongdoing so that the rotten eggs in government can be purged.

The ongoing election campaign offers many opportunities for showing civic responsibility, by reporting abuses and violations of campaign rules. Public vigilance is critical in preventing anarchy during the campaign.

It also takes courage to fight the army of trolls engaged in the spread of fake news, disinformation and other malicious content, and to work for the promotion of an informed vote.

The nation commemorates today the courage of those who fought and died in defense of the country during World War II. It is also a day for pondering how one can serve the country in ordinary ways, every single day.
