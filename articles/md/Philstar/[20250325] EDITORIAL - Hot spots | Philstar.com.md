The dry season has not yet started, but after a monsoon-induced cool weekend, hot weather is expected this week, according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration.

Earlier this month, classes were suspended in many schools while others shifted to remote learning modes as PAGASA warned of extremely high heat index – how the body perceives the combined temperature and humidity in shaded areas.

As the country experiences many weeks of high heat and humidity during the dry season, however, class suspensions cannot be the default response to high heat index warnings. The academic year is just starting to be moved back to the pre-pandemic calendar, whose opening coincides with the onset of the wet season.

Apart from schools, other sectors must craft long-term plans to deal with high heat. A study released recently ranked the Philippines third among 51 Asian countries and territories that experienced unusual heat between December 2024 and February 2025.

The study, covering 940 cities and 220 countries and jurisdictions, was conducted by the non-profit Climate Central. It linked the unusual heat to climate change, with the Philippines ranking only behind Brunei and Maldives.

Climate scientists have pointed out that population density, pollution and land development patterns can intensify heat in mega cities. The study showed Metro Manila placing third along with Indonesian capital Jakarta among 38 Asian mega cities – those with a population of at least 10 million – that experienced high heat linked to climate change for at least 30 days. Only Lagos, Nigeria and Tamil Nadu in India ranked ahead of Manila and Jakarta.

Apart from disrupting classes, high heat can also ruin crops and affect fisheries, affecting food security. It poses serious health risks especially to vulnerable sectors such as the elderly, young children and persons with disabilities. Even the spike in dengue cases has been linked to high humidity. Extreme heat has also triggered massive forest fires, which destroy ecosystems.

Dealing with such problems calls for sustained, long-term programs to reduce the impact of climate change. There are also mitigation measures that can be carried out within a shorter period, such as the provision of green spaces particularly in urban communities where the public can take refuge from the heat. Rules on indoor ventilation can be tightened for schools, workplaces and commercial areas.

Seeing the disruptive impact of high heat, no government can afford inaction. The problem must be given the urgent attention that it deserves.
