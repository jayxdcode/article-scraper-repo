Considering the amounts of the flood control projects currently under scrutiny, those accused of involvement in anomalies are likely to be indicted for plunder.

This normally means no bail for those who will face charges in court. Conviction can put the offender in prison for life. Assets can be forfeited and even children who are used as dummies in wrongdoing can be included in criminal indictments. Their families could lose everything; it would spell the end of their life as they know it. Under Republic Act 7080, which defines the crime of plunder, there is no statute of limitations for the forfeiture of ill-gotten assets.

Immigration lookout bulletins have been issued for several contractors and officials of the Department of Public Works and Highways. The list of those covered is expected to grow longer in the coming days.

A lookout bulletin cannot prevent departure from the country. But even if some of those covered by lookout bulletins manage to leave, the country can still seek their arrest if warranted, through the International Criminal Police Organization. The Interpol has 196 member countries. The guilty can run, but it can be difficult to hide.

It is also said that flight indicates guilt. The best recourse for those under a lookout bulletin is to cooperate in any investigation. For the innocent, it will be the quickest and decisive way to clear one’s name. For the guilty, cooperation can be a mitigating factor.

And for the others who are reportedly sighing that they were forced by the kalakaran or prevailing practice in the industry to resort to corrupt practices in public works, they might consider blowing the whistle or turning state witness.

According to reports, feelers are currently being sent to the Department of Justice and certain senators by people who want to testify. The feelers deserve encouragement.

Those who are sending them must pursue their initiative. The ideal reason is of course because they are believers in public accountability and want to do their part, even if belatedly, in promoting good governance. For practical reasons, testifying could spell the difference between a few years and life in prison. Their families might even get to keep some of their assets.
