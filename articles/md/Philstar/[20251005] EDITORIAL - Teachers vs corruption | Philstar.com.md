In the systematic theft of public funds, practically all government services suffer.

Those trillions in tax money estimated to have gone down the corruption drain could have expanded public health coverage. Health professionals could have been provided higher pay, preventing them from seeking greener pastures overseas. There could be fewer children growing up physically and mentally stunted due to lack of food and proper nutrients.

Several billions could have built roads maintained by the government and needing no payment of stiff tolls, particularly within traffic-choked Mega Manila. Farm support services including post-harvest and cold chain facilities as well as farm-to-market roads could have been implemented.

Public safety could have been boosted and minimum credible defense capability achieved.

And yes, greater investment in education and innovation could have been made. There would be no backlog of 165,000 classrooms, a teacher shortage of at least 30,000, and a continuing inadequacy of practically all supplies and facilities including clean water in the public school system.

Last Friday, teachers across the country walked out of their classes to protest against the corruption on a grand scale that is now being laid bare. The walkout was staged ahead of World Teachers’ Day today.

The global theme of this special day, co-convened by UNESCO, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the International Labor Organization and Education International, is “recasting teaching as a collaborative profession.”

In the Philippines, however, because of recent developments, the focus of the special day inevitably is on corruption and its pernicious impact on education.

Seeing those massive piles of cash stolen from the people, which supposedly went to the kickbacks of crooked public officials, hearing public works engineers blowing millions in casinos, and watching contractors flaunting ill-gotten wealth have triggered widespread public outrage.

The still unfolding scandal over corruption in the budget process and flood control is giving the nation a clearer picture of the quality of political representation in this country.

Making informed choices in elections is critical in good governance and strong democratic institutions. For the younger generations, making informed choices will depend a great deal on the quality of education, in which teachers obviously play a critical role. Greater investment in education, including teachers’ welfare, is one of the best foils against corruption.
