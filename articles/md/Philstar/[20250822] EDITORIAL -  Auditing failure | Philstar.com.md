All eyes are currently on the contractors, their political patrons and officials of the Department of Public Works and Highways.

But Sen. Panfilo Lacson, in his impressive privilege speech last Wednesday, mentioned another key player in what he described as the “flooded gates of corruption” in flood mitigation infrastructure: state auditors.

In his slide presentation, Lacson estimated that about 60 percent of the cost of flood control projects went to kickbacks, with the biggest share of 20 to 25 percent going to the politicians who earmark the projects for funding, followed by DPWH officials, mostly district engineers.

About 0.5 to one percent of the dirty money, however, goes to state auditors, according to Lacson’s slide presentation.

Lacson had pointed out numerous non-existent or ghost flood control projects in three provinces alone. Several of the projects have been marked as completed. How could this have happened if even a perfunctory inspection of the project was conducted by state auditors?

By simply comparing documents of completed and ongoing projects with the sites stated in the contracts, which were inspected on site by his staff, Lacson clearly illustrated that the projects were non-existent.

President Marcos, acting on tips relayed to his office, also personally inspected the declared site of a flood control project, and found nothing. This was on top of a project in Bulacan whose concrete embankment he found to be crumbling.

The Commission on Audit has many honest and dedicated personnel. The COA played a key role in exposing the massive misuse of the Priority Development Assistance Fund, which led the Supreme Court to ban the PDAF and other funding schemes similar to the congressional pork barrel.

Lawmakers soon found ways of going around the SC prohibition, posing new challenges to the COA. The massive corruption that is now being linked to substandard and non-existent flood control projects poses yet another challenge to the COA, which must undertake a thorough housecleaning.

The scandal highlights the need to strengthen the capacity of state auditors to carry out their job thoroughly and efficiently. Crooks have mastered the art of concealing the ways by which they pocket public funds. The COA needs more personnel and greater resources to stay one step ahead.
