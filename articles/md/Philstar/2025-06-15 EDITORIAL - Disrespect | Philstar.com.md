Impeachment is a political process, but more than this, it is a mechanism enshrined in the Constitution for holding public officials accountable to the people.

Under Article XI of the Constitution – which covers public accountability rather than the legislative department – the duty to try an impeached official rests in the Senate.

Lawmakers are politicians, and their alliances are well known. Sitting in judgment, however, intrinsically involves impartiality, with decisions based on evidence rather than personal or partisan biases. It may have been a mistake to give senators the responsibility to try and pass judgment on an impeached official; some countries have special courts for this. But the Philippines is stuck with this system, which is specified in the Constitution.

Removal by impeachment is meant to be in pursuit of the ideals set forth in Article XI: “Public office is a public trust. Public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives.”

Should political considerations trump such ideals? They often do, tragically for our country. The nation knows only too well that there are members of Congress who think being a lawmaker puts them above the law.

Such observations are being made as senators who now sit as judges in an impeachment court and have taken an oath to be impartial openly follow around the impeached official over whom they are supposed to pass judgment, Vice President Sara Duterte. Even if this is not a judicial proceeding, surely people can see impropriety in a judge cavorting with a defendant facing trial in his/her court.

The impeachment court has been convened, and all of the senators have taken their oath as judges. Can’t senators show a modicum of respect for the institution where they sit, and the Constitution that they are sworn to uphold? If some senators want to worship at the feet of the Vice President, can’t they wait at least until the case against her is dismissed by the court to which they belong before following her around like members of a fan club? Since they believe in her innocence, surely the dismissal won’t take long.

Senate President Francis Escudero has said the prosecutors of the House of Representatives are not co-equals of the senators in an impeachment trial, and must respect the orders of the impeachment court. But respect is earned, not demanded. If senators want respect, they should show that they deserve it. They can start by showing respect for their own rules, for the oath they have taken, and for the basic law of the land.
