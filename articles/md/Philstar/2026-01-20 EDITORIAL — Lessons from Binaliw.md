Ten days after a mountain of garbage collapsed at the Binaliw landfill in Cebu City, the last missing person was found on Sunday. The retrieval brought to 36 the number of people who died when a landslide crushed a materials recovery facility at the landfill, burying workers.

The 36th victim was found just days after President Marcos visited the disaster site last Thursday to condole with the families and assure the public that the government is pursuing safety, transparency and accountability in its response to the tragedy.

Authorities have said initial investigation pointed to a combination of the powerful earthquake and aftershocks that struck Cebu last year along wizth the extreme rainfall and flooding spawned by Typhoon Tino, which might have loosened the ground. Environmental groups, on the other hand, want a deeper probe to determine if the dump was operating properly as a landfill.

The disaster has also led to calls for inspections of other landfills in the country, including those used for trash disposal in Metro Manila. Accidents happen and nature is unpredictable, especially in this country that is one of the most prone to natural disasters. Still, there are ways of minimizing risks from working in hazardous environments, and there is always room for improving safety in garbage dumps.

In countries such as the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency uses on-site monitoring systems to check compliance with federal regulations covering ground contamination and the release of methane and carbon dioxide from the degradation of solid waste.

Apart from monitoring, the government may consider stepping up efforts to capture landfill gas and convert it into a renewable energy resource. This will also prevent methane from escaping into the atmosphere and aggravating global warming.

Cebu has declared a day of mourning for the victims of Binaliw and prayers continue to be offered for the victims and their bereaved relatives. The government must earnestly pursue what the President promised the victims. At the same time, the government can work with landfill operators to turn garbage into energy. Perhaps something good can come out of this tragedy.
