The Chinese government may deny it, but it will be prudent for the Philippines to ramp up resources and capabilities to defend itself against various forms of cyber warfare.

As of last night, there was no word from the Chinese embassy on the disclosure of a contract that it supposedly signed with a Makati-based marketing agency to run online troll farms against the Philippine government and national interests.

But in Beijing, the foreign ministry issued a terse denial of accusations that it was interfering in the Philippines’ midterm elections by spreading disinformation and supporting pro-China candidates and officials.

Senate Majority Leader Francis Tolentino disclosed the contract between the Chinese embassy and Infinitus Marketing Solutions Inc. during an inquiry on foreign espionage, held last Thursday by the Senate special committee on maritime and admiralty zones, which he chairs. Tolentino described it as “MIFI” or “malign, influence, foreign interference” operations.

The document showed the embassy contracting Infinitus to use “keyboard warriors” to push China’s narrative on its maritime dispute with the Philippines and to attack anti-Beijing Filipino officials using troll farms.

Foreign interference in elections is not unique to the Philippines. European Parliament member Marta Temido of Portugal, who heads the EU Election Observation Mission that is in town for the campaign and midterm polls in May, said yesterday that foreign interference is becoming “more common” in elections in the EU including in the European Parliament.

Temido told the media that the EU observers’ social media team would be closely monitoring trolling, disinformation and possible foreign interference related to the May 12 vote.

There are calls to indict Infinitus executives for treason. As of yesterday, the website of the company declared that it was undergoing “scheduled maintenance.” The Facebook page of InfinitUs PH listed its address at 6C Valero Tower in Salcedo Village, Makati. It described itself as “a boutique end-to-end marketing solutions company established in 2018 for growing middle-market businesses to upscale international clients.”

If the contract presented by Tolentino is genuine, among those “upscale international clients” is the Chinese government, working against Philippine national interests and possibly moving to undermine the upcoming elections. The Philippines must be able to confront this serious threat.
