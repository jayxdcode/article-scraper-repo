Before election day, about 600 cases of suspected vote-buying and abuse of state resources were reported to the Commission on Elections, with a surge noted in the last few days before the vote. Reports reaching the Comelec indicated that the buy-and-sell of votes continued on election day itself.

Just because an illegal activity is widespread does not legitimize the deed. And it is the duty of relevant authorities to stop the activity and prevent its recurrence.

As in other types of wrongdoing, the best path to preventing a repeat is showing that offenders are caught and punished. Those 600 cases must be pursued with zeal if the Comelec does not want more of the same by the time the general elections in 2028 come around.

Vote buying is most rampant in Metro Manila, but cases have also been reported in other parts of the country, according to Comelec officials, who stressed that violators can be pursued up to five years from the commission of the election offense. Offenders may include both winners and losers as well as those who sold their votes, the Comelec said.

Voters were sufficiently warned about this. Vote sellers cannot be saved by the argument that they merely accepted the “kindness” of candidates, or that they took what is their due from those who steal from public coffers but voted their conscience. One cannot correct a wrong with another wrong.

Even the International Observer Mission, which has deployed hundreds of foreign observers around the country,

has independently confirmed at least 18 cases of vote buying.

The foreign observers reported that vote buying ranged from P150 to P5,000, in cash or kind. They noted that vote buying was most prevalent in impoverished areas controlled by political dynasties. The Comelec, for its part, has received reports of amounts ranging from P50 to P10,000.

On the eve of the vote, the Comelec reminded the Philippine National Police that it is authorized to carry out the warrantless arrest of anyone caught in the act of buying and selling votes. The nation awaits an update on PNP compliance with the Comelec order.

Beyond arrests, people will monitor the prosecution and imposition of penalties on vote buyers and sellers, along with any candidate for whom the votes were bought.

The Comelec must come down hard on illegal and unfair campaign practices. If people see that the pronouncements of Comelec officials are nothing but empty threats, the illegal activities are sure to get worse in the 2028 general elections, when higher positions are at stake.
