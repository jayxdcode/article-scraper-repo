Corruption is a key concern of voters, and Chinese aggression against Philippine vessels in the West Philippine Sea has become an issue in the upcoming elections in May. This is according to a recent survey conducted by pollster Social Weather Stations Inc.

SWS survey results showed that voters would go for candidates in the midterm polls who are deemed to be addressing these concerns. This is a welcome development. The question is whether voters know who among the candidates have a solid track record in addressing these concerns, and who are those simply latching belatedly onto the issues or, worse, are making an opportunistic last-minute turnaround in their positions.

The SWS survey this month, commissioned by the Stratbase Group, showed that 78 percent of Filipinos prefer “a candidate who believes that the Philippines must assert our rights against China’s aggressive actions in the West Philippine Sea.” Twenty-two percent said they would go for candidates who did not believe in this. Support for this policy was highest in Metro Manila, followed by the rest of Luzon and then the Visayas and Mindanao.

Survey results on the Senate race, however, do not reflect this voter preference or the concern about corruption. The surveys conducted by reputable pollsters show similar results.

The results highlight the importance of voter education, and of improving the quality of education in general so that voters can make informed choices. These are challenges that call for a multipronged approach and the involvement of multiple sectors.

A recent incident has also raised concern on whether young Filipinos understand the importance of the right to vote, or even find elections relevant to their lives. A 20-year-old participant in a beauty contest on a television variety show, responding to a question, said she did not know enough about what the Commission on Elections does.

Maybe the young woman is too busy with her personal struggles, being an orphan and the family breadwinner supporting a sibling and a grandparent. The Comelec and other election stakeholders must work together to reach out to such voters, to explain how an informed vote can bring meaningful change and improve the quality of life.
