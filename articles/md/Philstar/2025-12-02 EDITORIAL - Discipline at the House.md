By an overwhelming vote of 249, with only five against and 11 abstaining, the House of Representatives suspended for 60 days without pay Cavite 4th District Rep. Francisco Barzaga over what a colleague described as “reckless, offensive and irresponsible use of his social media platform.”

During plenary session yesterday, the House adopted the recommendations of the committee on ethics and privileges, which found Barzaga guilty of disorderly behavior, in violation of House rules and Republic Act 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees. Barzaga was also ordered to take down the social media posts.

The National Unity Party led by Antipolo 1st District Rep. Ronaldo Puno filed the ethics complaint against Barzaga, a former NUP member who has been posting criticisms against his House colleagues, Senate President Vicente Sotto III and Cabinet members, along with lewd photos.

Barzaga has also accused President Marcos of betrayal of public trust. Police have filed charges against Barzaga for inciting to sedition and inciting to rebellion.

Some quarters have dismissed Barzaga as a slightly unhinged attention-seeker. Some of his colleagues have expressed concern about his mental health. His behavior can be bizarre, and might be remembered by his constituents if he seeks reelection.

It’s not the first time that congressmen have disciplined one of their own. The House in the previous Congress expelled Arnolfo Teves Jr. when he refused to return to the country to face murder charges for the killing of Negros Oriental governor Roel Degamo and nine others.

In May last year, the House also censured Davao del Norte 1st District Rep. Pantaleon Alvarez for “seditious” remarks at a rally in Tagum City, wherein he urged the military to withdraw support for President Marcos.

Perhaps the House can also enhance its rules and disciplinary mechanisms to prevent the commission of the criminal activities now being imputed on dozens of its members, in connection with anomalous infrastructure projects and the mangling of the national budget.

It’s good to see congressmen imposing discipline on one of their own. It will be better if they can also impose sanctions on worse forms of misbehavior in their ranks. And it will be best if they can institutionalize reforms that will prevent a repeat of this epic thievery of public funds.
