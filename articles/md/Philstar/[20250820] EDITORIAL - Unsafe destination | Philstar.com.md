Travel arrivals from South Korea – for many years the largest source of foreign tourists in the Philippines – have been going down, thanks to unsolved crimes targeting Koreans in the Philippines.

Now the Japanese may follow, after two of their citizens were shot dead last Friday as they got out of a taxi in Manila.

The Department of Tourism was the first government agency to condemn the attack staged by motorcycle-riding gunmen along Malvar street.

“Tourism, a vital pillar of livelihood for millions of Filipinos, heavily depends on creating and maintaining conditions of peace, safety and security. We note with deep concern that recent events have already prompted advisories from foreign embassies in the country’s top visitor source markets, which could adversely affect tourist confidence and the Philippines’ image as a safe and welcoming destination,” the department said, without naming the embassies.

Japan has one of the lowest crime rates in the world. The safe environment is seen as one of the factors for its high tourist arrivals. Last year, because of a weaker yen that made visiting the country more affordable, Japan drew 36.87 million international visitors, surpassing its top pre-pandemic record.

The Philippines, on the other hand, has a reputation for armed violence targeting Filipinos and foreigners alike.

On Monday, the Manila Police Department said it was holding for questioning two persons of interest in the fatal attack on the Japanese, which was recorded on surveillance video. The arrest and prosecution of the killers should be swift.

Korean visitors have been spooked by the killing of a Korean tourist in Angeles City, Pampanga last April 21. The victim was standing in front of a bank when two men on a motorcycle pulled up and snatched his bag. When he resisted, he was shot in the body.

In the past five years, over 3,000 Koreans have been victims of various crimes in the Philippines, according to South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On May 2 this year, two Koreans en route to a fishing trip in Nasugbu, Batangas were kidnapped by about 10 armed captors. The two were freed after three days.

On May 18, two Korean tourists lost their designer bags to two armed robbers on a motorcycle in BGC.

Angeles City was also where Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo was kidnapped by policemen in the guise of a drug bust in October 2016. Jee was strangled to death in his own car inside Camp Crame, with the convicted mastermind still at large, former police colonel Rafael Dumlao.

Such concerns are driving away Korean visitors. China has also warned its citizens about personal safety risks when traveling to the Philippines.

Beyond tourism, everyone in this country must be kept safe.
