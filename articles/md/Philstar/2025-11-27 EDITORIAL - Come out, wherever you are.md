The stories of corruption being alleged by Elizaldy Co are becoming more dismaying – if they are true.

If the resigned Ako Bicol party-list congressman is hurling the allegations out of the goodness of his heart, because he cares for his country and not simply because he’s trying to save his neck and his vast fortune, he must give his accusations legal legs to stand on.

Co must allow his statements to be subjected to scrutiny by credible authorities. Wherever he is holed out on the planet, he must swear to the truthfulness of his statements. The stories must be backed by solid evidence that will prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is required for judicial courts to convict a defendant for such serious crimes.

Until Co can do this, he can hurl the wildest accusations, but these will have the probative value of fake news generated through artificial intelligence.

The ones who may find such statements useful are those pursuing personal agendas to gain power through extraconstitutional means. These are people who think that amid the still growing scandal over budget insertions and flood control anomalies, the country is best served by throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Those flirting with this idea should remember the admonition to be careful what you wish for.

In the latest installment of his “tell-all” video series, Co cited even more mind-boggling amounts supposedly paid as kickbacks to President Marcos and resigned speaker Martin Romualdez.

It is easy to make the worst accusations, if the accuser is beyond the reach of authorities who can hold him accountable for the truthfulness of his statements.

If Co wants the President ousted, the objective will be difficult to attain through statements not issued under oath by a fugitive.

Co’s Philippine passport has been canceled and a court-issued warrant for his arrest would pave the way for a red notice that could lead to his arrest through the Interpol. It would be better if he returns to the country voluntarily, and attest to the veracity of his accusations.
