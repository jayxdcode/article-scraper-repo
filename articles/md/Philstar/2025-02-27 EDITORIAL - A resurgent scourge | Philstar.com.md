Videos are circulating online, featuring horrific scenes of torture of a 14-year-old Chinese boy who was kidnapped on Feb. 20. In this age of generative artificial intelligence, the accuracy of the videos can be difficult to determine.

At least the boy, a student of an exclusive school in Taguig, has been found abandoned in Parañaque and brought to a hospital for medical attention. Law enforcement officials maintained that no ransom was paid for the release of the boy.

The kidnappers are suspected to be mainland Chinese nationals with links to Philippine offshore gaming operations, whose cohorts are Filipino military and police personnel. Whether the Filipinos have been dismissed from the service has yet to be established. POGO operators have been known to employ local soldiers and cops as bodyguards. In May last year, commandos of the elite police Special Action Force assigned in Mindanao were caught moonlighting as security escorts of Chinese POGO officials in Ayala Alabang Village in Muntinlupa.

It’s not the first time that ransom kidnapping has been linked to POGO operations. Since offshore gaming was launched in the Philippines during the Duterte administration, POGO officials and employees have been arrested in connection with kidnapping, torture, human trafficking and even murder, apart from a wide range of cyberscams.

The challenge is to prevent the spread of POGO-linked crimes. Law enforcement agencies have said Filipinos have taken over offshore gaming and are operating “guerrilla-style” since the total POGO ban took effect at the start of this year.

The kidnapping of a Chinese student could encourage a revival of the scourge that plagued the country in the 1990s when the principal targets were members of the Chinese-Filipino community. A bloody crackdown on the kidnapping spree eventually put an end to the menace in Metro Manila and other parts of Luzon, although ransom kidnapping remained a major fund-raiser for bandits in Mindanao led by the Abu Sayyaf.

Since then, the problem has popped up periodically all over the country, with the resurgent spree ending only with the arrest or neutralization of the perpetrators. Following the release of the teenage student, President Marcos reportedly ordered the PNP yesterday to wipe out kidnapping syndicates.

If the government wants to prevent ransom kidnapping from again becoming a cottage industry in the country, the perpetrators of the latest kidnapping must be caught ASAP. The best deterrent to crime is the certainty of being caught and punished.
