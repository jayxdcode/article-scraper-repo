Classes were suspended in several areas in Metro Manila last Thursday because of heavy rainfall that caused flooding at daybreak. Tropical depression Bising has left the country, but more heavy rainfall is forecast this weekend by the weather bureau.

According to the Mines and Geosciences Bureau, at least 664 barangays in Luzon, 412 of them in Metro Manila, are at risk of rain-induced flooding, landslides and debris flow.

The start of the heavy flooding this year revived questions about the utilization of billions of pesos allocated for flood control programs. Parts of Metro Manila especially in the western section are low-lying areas that are gradually sinking into the sea, with the phenomenon exacerbated by rising sea levels caused by global warming.

But there is technology to impound rainfall and utilize the water for various purposes such as irrigation, and to redirect floodwaters to minimize their disruptive impact. Advances in water filtration now allow the harnessing even of “dirty” or wastewater from households and offices for recycling into potable water.

With the billions allocated every year for flood control across the country, there should be adequate pumping stations, dikes and spillways to reduce flooding. At the very least, there should be efficient flood pumping stations particularly in densely populated urban centers to allow floods to subside quickly.

And yet the country continues to be surprised by heavy rainfall that causes floodwaters to rise so rapidly people have no time to bring their belongings to higher ground.

On Oct. 24 last year, Severe Tropical Storm Kristine brought intense rainfall that spawned devastating flash floods particularly in Bicol. Kristine left at least 116 people dead and another 39 missing. The storm damaged an estimated P971 million in infrastructure and P5.75 billion worth of agricultural and fisheries resources.

Senators noted that between 2018 and 2024, the Bicol Region had received a total of P133 billion for flood control projects of the Department of Public Works and Highways. Under the National Expenditure Program proposed by the executive for 2025, flood control was allocated P303 billion or nearly 34 percent of the total.

Anti-corruption watchdogs have pointed out that flood control projects are among the major sources of graft, with the projects difficult to monitor for proper implementation. The consequences have been deadly and devastating to infrastructure, agriculture and private property.

A thorough audit is needed to see where the billions released for flood control went. Like rainfall, tax money should not be allowed to simply go down the drain.
