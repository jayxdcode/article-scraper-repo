Invoking the promotion of transparency and accountability, Malacañang says President Marcos is ready to support a proposed law requiring public officials to waive their bank secrecy privileges.

Whether lawmakers will go along with the proposal, however, remains to be seen. Sen. Francis Escudero had filed a bill in the previous Congress, seeking to require all public officials and employees, except those serving in an honorary capacity, to waive the secrecy of their bank deposits.

The bill, which sought to amend Republic Act 1405, the 1955 Law on Secrecy of Bank Deposits, and RA 6426 or the Foreign Currency Deposit Act, languished in the legislature, so Escudero has refiled the measure in the current Congress.

Under the proposed bill, all government personnel must submit a written waiver authorizing the Office of the Ombudsman to look into all their bank deposits and investments including foreign currency accounts.

The ombudsman is mandated to serve as a vanguard of public accountability. The current ombudsman, unfortunately, will be remembered instead for promoting the opposite, by barring public access to the annual statements of assets, liabilities and net worth submitted by all government officials. It is the first time since the creation of the Office of the Ombudsman, which started out as the Tanodbayan, that access to the SALNs was restricted.

No lawmaker protested strenuously against this move, so Escudero’s bill will likely face rough sailing even if he secures a fresh mandate as Senate president.

Instead lawmakers have strenuously rejected every effort to even ease bank secrecy laws, or discuss proposals to define and prohibit racketeering. Lawmakers have also rejected every effort to bring transparency to election campaign financing, which has allowed the laundering of dirty money into politics.

The Philippines is also among about 40 countries, mostly developing states in Africa, that have not joined the Common Reporting Standard. States participating in the CRS commit to have their financial institutions automatically exchange tax information on resident accounts. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development initiated the CRS in 2014 as a mechanism for the global fight against tax evasion.

Escudero noted that while the secrecy of bank deposits was meant to encourage savings and spur economic development, it has become a shield for illegal activities. It “has enabled corruption to thrive under the guise of confidentiality,” with the secrecy undermining democracy, he said.

Among the biggest beneficiaries of this secrecy, however, are politicians themselves. The 20th Congress must go beyond lip service in supporting transparency.
