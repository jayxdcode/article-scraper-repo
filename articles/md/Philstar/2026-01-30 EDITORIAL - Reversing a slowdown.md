Economic growth skidded to 4.4 percent in 2025, well below the government’s target of 5.5 to 6.5 percent.

In the fourth quarter of 2025, gross domestic product grew by just 3.0 percent – the slowest in nearly five years, since the height of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2021.

Economic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan admitted being surprised by the depth of the GDP slowdown, but said 2026 would be a “rally point” to reverse the trend and rebuild public confidence.

Balisacan admitted that the corruption scandal involving flood control and other infrastructure projects contributed to the economic slowdown along with extreme weather disturbances, aside from economic headwinds overseas.

Corruption scandals rock other countries, with minimal or no impact on their economies and business confidence.

The reason the scandal is so destabilizing in the Philippines is the uncertainty of the outcome. In other countries such as South Korea, those accused of corruption and other anomalies are quickly arrested, jailed while facing swift trial, convicted and punished. Public apologies and sincere expressions of remorse are common.

Reforms to prevent a repeat of the anomalies are rapidly and decisively implemented. And the bureaucracy, generally perceived to be professional, is largely insulated from political scandals and continues to perform efficiently.

These are not seen in the Philippines, where there has been a long string of major corruption scandals, with the big fish all getting away. The current scandal involves lawmakers, who are supposed to legislate reforms, and the budget process itself. The bureaucracy is tainted by corruption and is highly politicized, with grease money needed to get things done at all levels of government, from the barangay to the top.

Balisacan, in a press conference on the 2025 GDP, said: “We are accelerating efforts to restore public trust through improvements in governance and public services.” He said growth momentum could be regained, with the government targeting 5.0 to 6.0 percent expansion this year.

Some analysts are less sanguine, noting that the momentum of accountability promised in the flood control mess has also slowed down.

The best way to reverse the economic slowdown and achieve government targets is to show the world that those behind the corruption scandal are identified, prosecuted swiftly and punished, particularly the big fish. The nation must also show that at this point, significant long-term reforms are already underway, to prevent a repeat of the corruption and to stop impunity.
