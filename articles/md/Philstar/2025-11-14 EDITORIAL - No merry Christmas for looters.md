It’s good to hear President Marcos promising that Christmas won’t be merry for public officials and their cohorts in the private sector who are accused of stealing an estimated trillions of pesos in public funds meant for flood control and other infrastructure projects.

The President has indicated that those who will land behind bars will include certain lawmakers.

Even better than seeing accused thieves – especially the big fish – tossed in jail is giving the public reasonable ground to believe that guilt will be established quickly and with finality, so that punishment can be imposed and justice served.

Despite the ongoing investigations and indictments, the biggest concern of the public is that in the end, the big fish will again get away and only the small fry will land in the national prisons. Such a situation will guarantee long-term impunity.

The President was echoing statements issued by Ombudsman Jesus Crispin Remulla and Public Works Secretary Vince Dizon, who see criminal cases filed in court beginning next week against dozens of former and incumbent officials as well as private contractors.

Remulla has said several of the cases could involve malversation through falsification of public documents – an offense that will not allow bail for amounts involving at least P8.8 million, and which could merit life in prison.

Such cases, Remulla has pointed out, could be easier to prosecute than accusations of plunder, which covers amounts of at least P50 million, and which requires proof beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant directly benefited from stolen public funds.

Indictments for plunder, however, are also being explored, along with other graft-related cases, Remulla has said. Tax evasion, money laundering and asset forfeiture cases are also being pursued by various agencies.

The President, in a press conference yesterday, vowed that those responsible for the shameless theft of public funds will land in prison and will return stolen money. At the same time, he promised that reforms would be implemented to put an end to institutionalized thievery.

The people will hold him to these promises.
