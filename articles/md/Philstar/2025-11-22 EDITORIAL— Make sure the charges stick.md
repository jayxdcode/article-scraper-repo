More than three months after President Marcos launched his anti-corruption campaign with a call for crooks to have some shame – “mahiya naman kayo” – serious criminal charges were recommended yesterday against his first cousin, former House speaker Martin Romualdez.

The President himself broke the news early yesterday on what came hours later: the Department of Public Works and Highways and the Independent Commission for Infrastructure formally recommended to the Office of the Ombudsman the filing of charges for plunder, direct bribery and graft against Romualdez and the former chairman of the House appropriations committee, Elizaldy Co.

As the country has seen too often in the past, however, there’s a long, tortuous road between criminal indictment and final conviction, especially when big names are involved.

The ongoing corruption scandal involving the budget process and flood control has already led to leadership changes in both chambers of Congress.

Those implicated in the scandal include some of the wealthiest and most well-connected in the country, and the list continues to grow.

The politicians are all insisting on their innocence. They will be fighting for their lives as well as their political and family fortunes. And they will be using their vast fortunes for their legal defense. The government must be ready for a bruising battle. Plunder in particular can be difficult to prove beyond reasonable doubt.

Romualdez has maintained his innocence and has said he is ready to face the charges. Co resigned as Ako Bicol party-list representative rather than return to the country to face the accusations against him.

Instead, Co has posted several video messages deflecting blame from himself and accusing the President and Romualdez of getting P25 billion in kickbacks from P100 billion in budget insertions in the 2025 national outlay.

Malacañang has dismissed the story as preposterous. The ombudsman, meanwhile, has filed charges before the Sandiganbayan against Co along with several former public works officials and contractors, paving the way for Co’s arrest with Interpol help.

Cases against the big fish must be so airtight defense teams cannot resort to the usual delaying tactics so they can later invoke “inordinate delay” to demand the dismissal of the charges. The cases must be tight enough to allow the judicial courts to carry out their constitutional mandate of speedy trial.

The government cannot afford to file cases haphazardly just to quickly appease calls for blood of people outraged by the corruption scandal.
