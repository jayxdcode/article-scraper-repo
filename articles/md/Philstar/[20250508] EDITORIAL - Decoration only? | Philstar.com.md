With citizens raising concern about possible anomalies, Malacañang has announced a probe into the procurement of bollards used at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport.

The issue cropped up following the accident at the NAIA Terminal 1 last Sunday, when a sport utility vehicle moved out of a parking slot at the departure drop-off roadway, plowed into the crowd and slammed into the airport glass wall. NAIA bollards failed to stop the SUV, whose driver said he got confused and had stepped on the accelerator.

Bollards are supposed to be sturdy steel posts embedded at intervals along roads and sidewalks, serving as traffic cues as well as protection for people and structures precisely from such vehicular accidents. Yet the NAIA bollards crumpled when hit by the Ford Everest, which pinned to death a four-year-old girl and a 29-year-old man and injured several others.

The Manila International Airport Authority said the bollards weren’t installed deep enough into the concrete because it could damage the structure, with debris possibly falling onto the arrival roadway below.

But an accomplishment report of the MIAA on the procurement stated that the bollards were meant to “promote terminal safety by preventing the vehicles from ramming into the walls of the terminals at the curbside parking areas.”

If the posts can’t serve their purpose of protecting from such accidents, are they there merely for decoration? That’s a costly airport decoration, if reports are accurate that the bollard procurement for all the NAIA terminals in 2019 cost taxpayers P8 million.

While scrutinizing the deal, Malacañang may want to expand the probe to the procurement of bollards by other agencies including local government units, which use smaller ones for bicycle lanes. The expanded probe can also cover other road safety devices such as cat’s eyes and rock netting to prevent soil erosion.

Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong has said crooks get up to 70 percent in kickbacks from the procurement of such road safety devices. Funds are taken from the Road User’s Tax that is collected in the registration of every motorized vehicle.

The tragedy at the NAIA highlights the consequences of poor implementation of road safety projects, or if the suspicions prove correct, of corruption. The government must ensure that the probe will be credible and will lead to reforms in promoting public safety.
