Just over a week after a magnitude 6.9 earthquake devastated Cebu, an even more powerful quake struck the Davao Region yesterday morning.

The 7.4-magnitude tectonic earthquake, with its epicenter traced offshore in Davao Oriental, sent people rushing out of schools, office buildings and residential structures, and sparked tsunami warnings all the way to Indonesia.

It also elicited announcements from government officials about inspections of buildings and public works infrastructure for structural integrity. The task falls mainly on the Department of Public Works and Highways, which has the engineering manpower and resources to conduct periodic inspections and retrofitting of DPWH-built structures.

Such assessments and engineering interventions were recommended two decades ago, in a study focusing on the “Big One” in Metro Manila. The study was conducted by the Japan International Cooperation Agency together with the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority.

In the past two decades, how many such assessments and retrofitting were actually carried out by the DPWH? Brice Hernandez, recently sacked as DPWH assistant district engineer for Bulacan’s first district, had told the Senate that all flood control projects in that area were substandard.

Authorities are still trying to determine how many other DPWH projects, including schools, farm-to-market and other roads as well as hospitals, are substandard. Yesterday, all road reblocking projects for minor repairs were suspended by DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon on suspicion that these were unnecessary projects meant merely for kickbacks.

The same cloud of doubt now hangs over DPWH infrastructure retrofitting. Even if such projects were approved and listed as completed, a new round may be needed, in the light of the collapse of two concrete-and-steel bridges, one of them brand-new, this year alone in Northern Luzon.

There wasn’t even an earthquake when a portion of the Cabagan-Santa Maria Bridge in Isabela collapsed on Feb. 27, less than a month after its retrofitting was supposedly completed. The P1.2-billion bridge had to be retrofitted due to flaws detected in 2023. This cost an additional P274.8 million, with the contract awarded to the same company that built the bridge.

Last Monday, the Piggatan Bridge in Cagayan also collapsed, even without an earthquake. Both incidents have been blamed on overloaded trucks. The 45-year-old Piggatan Bridge was retrofitted only once, in 2016, at a cost of P11.7 million. With that modest amount, there are questions on whether any actual retrofitting was done.

With powerful earthquakes in recent weeks, the specter of death and destruction from badly maintained infrastructure is haunting the country. Once again there is talk of retrofitting. Those in charge must be reminded that they are supposed to reinforce public infrastructure and not their personal bank accounts.
