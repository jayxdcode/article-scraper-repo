After weeks of brushing aside calls for his resignation, Manuel Bonoan finally stepped down as secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways. A replacement was quickly announced yesterday: Vince Dizon is the new DPWH chief.

Dizon, who carried out several laudable moves as head of the Department of Transportation, now has the unenviable job of dismantling the seemingly impenetrable web of corruption for which the DPWH has gained notoriety.

He is taking over a department that will be facing investigation by multiple agencies for questionable projects believed to have cost trillions of pesos in wasted public funds.

At the same time, Dizon is expected to implement structural reforms that will prevent a repeat of the large-scale corruption now being linked to flood control projects alone. Anti-graft advocates say the rotten system affects other public works projects including roads, bridges and even the construction of public schools.

Dizon will be dealing with lawmakers and other politicians as well as influence-peddling groups that have long been suspected of complicity in the corruption, but could not be pinned down due to the lack of material evidence or witnesses.

And he will have to work with the construction industry to promote best practices that will put an end to unfair competition through bribery, promote transparency and accountability in their dealings with the DPWH, and put an end to substandard projects.

The reputation of contractors is currently in tatters, with even their children placed under the harsh glare of public scrutiny. It is in their own interest to cleanse their ranks, develop credibility and promote pride in what they do based on a job well done rather than on whose palms they greased to bag multibillion-peso contracts.

Dizon can take cues from Sen. Panfilo Lacson and Baguio Mayor Benjamin Magalong, who have outlined various modes by which corruption leads to defective or, worse, non-existent or ghost public infrastructure projects.

While overseeing the DPWH housecleaning, Dizon will also carry out the main task of the department, which is to address the inadequacy of public works infrastructure nationwide.

He will have to do this while eradicating the biggest hindrance to the DPWH mandate: endemic corruption.
