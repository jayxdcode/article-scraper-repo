Thanks to more infrastructure spending, access to basic drinking water, sanitation and hygiene or WASH facilities improved last year.

This is according to the Annual Poverty Indicators Survey conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority. The preliminary results of the 2024 APIS showed that the number of families with access to basic drinking water facilities went up from 96.3 percent in 2022 to 97.5 percent in 2024, or about 28.01 million families. The PSA also reported a decline in the number of families with limited and unimproved access to safe water.

Access to basic sanitation facilities also improved, from 84 percent of families in 2022 to 84.7 percent in 2024. But those with unimproved or without sanitation facilities remained at 2.7 and 2.6 percent, respectively, according to the PSA.

Economists welcomed the report, but stressed that there’s still room for improvement, particularly in rural areas and in the most depressed regions – the Bangsamoro, which recorded the lowest access to drinking water at 88.2 percent, followed by Mimaropa and the Cordillera Administrative Region.

The percentage shares may look small, but they translate into millions of people still lacking or having limited and unimproved access to safe water and basic sanitation facilities. That’s still millions of people without proper toilets, with many still defecating in the open.

Health experts have stressed the importance of handwashing and toilet hygiene in avoiding diseases. The country aims to meet by 2030 the Sustainable Development Goal of universal access to basic sanitation.

This problem is costly to the economy; poor health and illness affect productivity and raise public health care expenses. Providing sufficient water and sanitation facilities for universal access nationwide is a worthy investment with significant returns. Experts, however, have noted slow progress particularly in the goal of eliminating open defecation, which impacts the health not only of the individual but also of the community.

The improvements recorded in the PSA survey are welcome developments, but the government must intensify efforts to expand and improve water and sanitation services so that even remote and underserved communities are reached.
