People complain about poor internet connectivity at home. This connectivity doesn’t fall from the sky; it’s a service provided by private companies. And one of the major providers, Globe Telecom Inc., has issued a rare statement, citing difficulties not just in its expansion programs, but even in carrying out maintenance work and restoration of service in gated communities.

The company pointed to access restrictions, steep fees and administrative barriers imposed by several homeowners’ associations, which have delayed the restoration of network services. Apart from permit requirements, the HOAs impose unreasonable entry fees and construction bonds, some of which “are recurring, excessive, or undefined in scope,” Globe said.

“In one of the identified villages, Globe workers are required to pay Php100,000 for access, with no clear validity period,” the statement declared. “Another village imposes access costs at Php5,000 per day, regardless of activity type, while other subdivisions do not allow the extension of fiber facilities altogether, effectively preventing residents from accessingupgraded services.”

Globe is urging HOAs and local government units to support the connectivity projects, particularly urgent service restoration works.

It’s not the first time that telecommunications providers have grappled with HOA resistance to telco infrastructure. When internet service was just starting to be rolled out in the country, the telcos had to contend with fears that their cell sites and cables would emit signals detrimental to human health.

While acknowledging the importance of security protocols in gated villages and committing to work with HOAs, Globe pointed out that the implementing rules and regulations of Republic Act 9904, the Magna Carta for Homeowners and Homeowners’ Associations, expressly prohibit the act of “preventing access to or restricting the entry of utility service providers, in order to install, maintain, or disconnect services pursuant to an approved contract or application.”

The company also cited Department Order No. 2022-012 of the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development, which states that consent is “not required for laying cables on existing poles, underground fiber ducts, and other physical telecommunications infrastructure.”

Globe stressed the importance of “timely access” to its telco infrastructure in preventing service disruptions and ensuring “seamless” mobile and broadband connectivity.

Local governments, long the subject of complaints for red tape and making doing business difficult for enterprises from micro to large, must step in and ask HOAs if they want that seamless service, or if they would prefer to return to analog rotary party line phone service.
