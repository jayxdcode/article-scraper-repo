Here’s another reason why the nation needs campaign finance reforms. A self-styled whistleblower has released a statement claiming that the election campaign of Sara Duterte for the vice presidency in 2022 included contributions from drug dealers and Philippine offshore gaming operators.

Accountability in this serious accusation would be easier with strong campaign finance regulation.

Ramil Madriaga, who reportedly served as part of the security team of Duterte, sent a handwritten letter to ML party-list Rep. Leila de Lima, claiming he has been “unjustly accused” of kidnapping and detained on the complaint of a client of  former presidential spokesman Harry Roque.

Madriaga also accused Roque and his wife of being behind the cancellation of the land title of Madriaga’s house in Mariveles, Bataan. Roque faces an arrest warrant issued by the Angeles City Regional Trial Court for qualified human trafficking related to the POGO hub Lucky South 99 in Porac, Pampanga.

According to Madriaga’s lawyer, the former security agent resented Duterte’s failure to help him in the kidnapping case, and prompted him to blow the whistle on the Vice President.

Accusations are easy to hurl. The challenge is proving them. The task in this case would be easier if the country has a credible system of regulating campaign finance. Even with the limited laws and rules in existence, loopholes are exploited to foil proper enforcement.

In a recent case, for example, the Commission on Elections cleared Sen. Francis Escudero and his supporter Lawrence Lubiano of violation of the Omnibus Election Code.

Lubiano, president of Centerways Construction and Development Inc., which has several infrastructure contracts with the government, contributed P30 million to Escudero’s Senate bid in 2022. Escudero declared this in his statement of contributions and expenditures or SOCE.

Section 95(c) of the election code prohibits direct or indirect contributions for “partisan political activity” by “natural and juridical persons who hold contracts or sub-contracts to supply the government or any of its divisions, subdivisions or instrumentalities, with goods or services or to perform construction or other works.”

But the Comelec ruled that Lubiano made the contribution in his personal capacity, and not as Centerways president. The ruling drew flak directed not only at the Comelec but also at Chairman George Garcia, who was an election lawyer of Escudero in 2022, and whose wife reportedly became deputy secretary for legislation at the Senate when Escudero was the president of the chamber.

The Comelec is still studying action in connection with Sen. Rodante Marcoleta’s public statement that he did not declare certain contributions in his SOCE because the donors did not want to be identified.

Going by previous experience, the rule on campaign finance is, anything goes.
