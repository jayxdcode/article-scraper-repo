The chairman of the Independent Commission for Infrastructure has finally been named, with little criticism so far. Along this line, it probably helps that retired associate justice Andres Reyes Jr. was appointed to the Supreme Court in 2017 by then president Rodrigo Duterte.

Reyes, who retired in 2020, will be working with former public works secretary Rogelio Singson and SGV country managing partner Rossana Fajardo as ICI members and Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong as special adviser.

Executive Order No. 94 dated Sept.11 allows the ICI to conduct a probe either based on a complaint or motu proprio related to anomalies in infrastructure projects, starting with those involving flood control, for the past 10 years.

Among other things, EO 94 allows the ICI to subpoena people as well as pertinent documents, including records of the Senate and the House of Representatives related to their ongoing probes into the flood control scandal.

The ICI can also request information and documents from the courts, including the Sandiganbayan and the Office of the Court Administrator, relevant to the cases being probed.

It can seek books, records, contracts and bank statements as well as request hold-departure orders or travel monitoring of persons under investigation or compel their return from abroad. It can seek asset freeze orders or seizure of assets, funds, deposits and properties “reasonably believed to be connected” to anomalous flood control and other infrastructure projects.

The ICI can recommend the suspension by relevant authorities of persons under probe by the commission.

Those are broad powers, which the ICI is expected to carry out through coordination with other offices such as the Department of Justice, the Bureau of Internal Revenue and Anti-Money Laundering Council.

Questions have been raised on what the ICI can do since it has no power to cite in contempt persons who ignore its subpoena. The EO states that government officials who defy the subpoena or refuse to take oath or affirmation before the ICI will face disciplinary action. Private persons “shall be dealt with in accordance with law.”

What that means exactly may be known only when the ICI buckles down to work, which it must do ASAP. It is expected to recommend administrative sanctions and the criminal prosecution of those covered by its mandate.

Public expectations are high, and the last thing President Marcos needs is to have the commission dismissed as a toothless tiger.
