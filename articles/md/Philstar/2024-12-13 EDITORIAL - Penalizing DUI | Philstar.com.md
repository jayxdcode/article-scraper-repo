As travel and revelry increase during the holidays, the Land Transportation Office has announced that it would be deploying breathalyzers nationwide to promote road safety. The LTO said random checks would be conducted among motorists across the country to discourage drunken driving amid the holding of many holiday get-togethers.

The announcement is welcome news, especially after recent incidents of major vehicular smashups that resulted in multiple deaths and injuries. The country ranks low in international assessments on road safety. Many of the worst accidents have been attributed to malfunctioning brakes, usually on poorly maintained vehicles. Often, the brakes fail as the vehicles are negotiating steep or sharply winding mountain roads. But many other accidents have been attributed to people who drive while drunk or drowsy. There have also been numerous deadly accidents involving drivers, particularly of buses and delivery trucks, taking shabu to stay awake on long-haul drives.

When the random checks detect alcohol levels beyond the allowed limit, LTO and other traffic enforcers should not hesitate in penalizing the drunk driver. In other countries, those caught driving under the influence are immediately tossed behind bars, at the very least to keep them off the streets until the alcohol is out of their system.

Those caught driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs must have their license suspended, with the period depending on the number of offenses. Recidivists must lose their driver’s license for good.  The Department of Health records an average of 12,000 people being killed in road accidents nationwide. The victims include drivers, passengers and people hit by vehicles.

Accidents can be prevented. Catching irresponsible people who drive while drunk is a positive step, but authorities must ensure that appropriate penalties are imposed, from fines to suspension of driver’s license and even jail time if warranted. The likelihood of punishment should serve as a strong incentive for people to practice responsible, defensive driving. Drunk drivers are endangering not only themselves but also other people and posing potential serious damage to property.
