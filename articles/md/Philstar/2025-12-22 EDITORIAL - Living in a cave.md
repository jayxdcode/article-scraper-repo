Any death due to unnatural causes, including through suicide or an accident, requires a police investigation, with an official police report on the circumstances of the death.

This is to rule out any foul play and ensure that a murder victim is not deprived of justice. Even if suicide is reported by relatives in the death of a person in his or her own home, police must step in to rule out foul play. It is not uncommon for people to murder their relatives, including their spouses, children and in-laws.

And this should be common knowledge to any police officer. Yet that knowledge appeared to have been lacking among the police officers who responded to the death of former public works undersecretary Maria Catalina Cabral.

Yesterday, the Philippine National Police announced that it was shifting its focus to securing evidence linked to the death of Cabral, described by probers as a key player in the corruption scandal related to flood control and other infrastructure projects undertaken by the agency where she had worked for decades, the Department of Public Works and Highways. This was after her identity was conclusively established over the weekend, the PNP said.

But Cabral’s driver had identified her outright, and didn’t anyone check for an ID? When someone dies of an unnatural cause, police have a duty to find out the identity of the fatality, ASAP.

In recent weeks, Cabral had gained notoriety in connection with budgeting anomalies related to DPWH projects. Her face had been all over multiple media platforms.

If the responding policemen failed to recognize at least Cabral’s name as mentioned by her driver, that was an inexcusable lapse, especially since the PNP is supposed to be assisting government agencies in the probe of the flood control mess. Have those police officers been living in a cave?

Now the PNP has joined anti-graft probers in trying to get custody of Cabral’s mobile phone, which the responding police officers had readily turned over to her relatives after her body was found on the night of Dec. 18.

The next day, Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla sacked the chiefs of police of Benguet province and the municipality of Tuba over the lapses.

Beyond relieving police officers of their duties, the case highlights a need to review the capabilities of the PNP in handling cases of unnatural deaths, starting with securing the site, recording the state in which the fatality is found and preserving possible pieces of evidence.

If the PNP now faces a wall of resistance in its efforts to piece together what happened, it has no one but itself to blame.
