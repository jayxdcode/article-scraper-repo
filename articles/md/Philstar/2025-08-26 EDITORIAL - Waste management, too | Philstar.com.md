Drowned out in the public outrage over corruption is a point raised by the embattled secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways: waste management, Manuel Bonoan has pointed out, also plays a critical factor in flood control.

And efficient waste management requires the cooperation of everyone. Not just the local governments, which are in charge of garbage collection and overall waste management, but also the general public, through proper waste disposal.

The problem is highlighted each time floodwaters subside, or after typhoons. Tons of garbage wash up on the shores around Manila Bay, and litter Roxas Boulevard and surrounding roads. Similar scenes are shown all over the flood-prone areas of Metro Manila.

Not just plastic products, but all sorts of materials discarded indiscriminately accumulate and end up clogging drainage systems and polluting waterways: tin cans, glass containers, paper, styrofoam and wood products, discarded appliances. And yes, drains are clogged even by the cigarette butts dropped anywhere, and the candy wrappers and used tissue paper tossed out the windows of motor vehicles.

Local government units have ordinances against littering. Like most laws and local ordinances in this country, however, something gets lost in enforcement. Filthy habits are reinforced by the certainty of getting away with littering.

In many areas, inefficient garbage collection and the lack of public trash receptacles also encourage littering. The sight of piles of uncollected garbage in the streets, with flies and cockroaches swarming around them, encourages people to toss their trash anywhere.

This problem is complicated by the proliferation of informal settlements in Metro Manila and other highly urbanized centers. Local governments must find ways of ensuring the efficiency of waste management while discouraging people from squatting especially in hazardous spots such as riverbanks.

Other factors apart from corruption and inefficiency in flood control projects have been cited for what people perceive to be worsening flooding. These include extreme weather attributed to climate change, reclamation projects that have blocked waterways and other natural flood outlets, poor waste management and filthy habits.

While authorities are pursuing crooks who have pocketed billions of pesos meant for flood control, everyone has a role to play in easing flooding.
