The Office of the Ombudsman and the Department of Justice see the first batch of criminal cases being filed in court within the month against those implicated in corruption related to flood control and other infrastructure anomalies.

Some of the charges being eyed cover offenses that won’t allow bail. The ombudsman and government prosecutors therefore see several accused offenders landing behind bars before Christmas.

The Supreme Court is doing its part by designating an initial batch of 26 regional trial courts in six major regions to handle the corruption cases and speed up adjudication. The move was announced by the SC over the weekend, as protest rallies related to the corruption scandal got underway.

This is a welcome move in the Philippine legal system, which has gained notoriety not only for moving at snail’s pace but also for corruption, as even foreign investors and the US State Department have pointed out.

Previous cases of public outrage over large-scale corruption involving the nation’s top officials – such as the pork barrel scam and the Pharmally scandal – have merely reinforced perceptions that the country has the best justice that money can buy.

A major concern among those disgusted by the latest revelations of shameless corruption is the uncertainty of seeing any major offender punished. Previous cases have created the impression that the bigger the fish and the larger the amount stolen from the people, the greater the chance of getting away with the crime.

Only the aides and gofers end up being punished for the criminal activities of their superiors, who not only enjoy their ill-gotten wealth, but even use it to ensure their perpetuation in power.

Against this backdrop, it’s good to know that the Supreme Court is making an effort to improve the administration of justice, starting with the raging controversy over corruption in the budget process and infrastructure projects.

Whether the trial courts will live up to public expectations remains to be seen. The SC must start cracking the whip on members of the judiciary who fail to provide the speedy justice mandated in the Constitution, in laws passed by Congress and in rules issued by the SC itself.

The appalling corruption scandal should open opportunities for sweeping and enduring reforms in what is seen to be a compromised legal system. From institutionalized looting, the country can emerge stronger through the institutionalization of a speedy, efficient and credible justice system.
