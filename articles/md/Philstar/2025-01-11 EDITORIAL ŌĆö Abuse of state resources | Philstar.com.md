Politicians taking personal credit for tax-funded social services is an “abuse of state resources” that could constitute an election offense. This is according to Chairman George Garcia of the Commission on Elections, who explained why the Comelec has banned the presence of politicians and their self-aggrandizing materials from venues where state aid or ayuda is being distributed.

The prohibition on the presence of politicians is a condition for the exemption granted by the Comelec to the delivery of various forms of state-funded aid and other social services during the election period, which begins on Jan. 12.

The exemption was sought by the Department of Social Welfare and Development for its numerous aid programs, including the conditional cash transfer under the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program or 4Ps and the unconditional dole-outs under the controversial Ayuda para sa Kapos ang Kita Program and the Assistance for Individuals in Crisis Situations.

AKAP and AICS funds, Garcia said, do not belong to politicians so these cannot be used for self-promotion related to the midterm elections in May. Politicians found showing up at AKAP, AICS and other ayuda-related events, in violation of the Comelec prohibition, could face the ultimate penalty of disqualification from the elections, Garcia said. Social welfare personnel who willfully allow politicians to violate the prohibition may also face administrative charges, he added. DSWD officials said yesterday that Comelec representatives would be invited to ayuda payout events, to ensure compliance with the prohibition.

Preventing the “abuse of state resources” should also be done throughout the government. Across the country, in both national and local government offices, claiming personal credit for tax-funded projects and programs has become the norm rather than the exception. Too many public officials and employees have blurred the line between public and private property. Ranking public officials are among the most notorious in treating the national coffers as their private piggy bank.

Lawmakers have institutionalized the use of billions in public funds for their personal purposes, through the annual General Appropriations Act. The Comelec prohibition on the injection of politics into social services should be a significant step in curbing this widespread abuse of state resources for personal gain. The initiative must be pursued beyond the election period, and applied across the government.
