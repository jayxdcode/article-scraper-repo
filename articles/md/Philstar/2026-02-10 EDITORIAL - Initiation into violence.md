No wonder there are members of the Philippine National Police who believe brutal force is an intrinsic part of law enforcement.

The country has two laws against violent initiation rites, the latest of which is Republic Act 11053, the Anti-Hazing Act of 2018. But RA 11053 is apparently unknown to the PNP regional office in the Bangsamoro Administrative Region.

At least 114 new recruits in the PNP BAR’s Mobile Force Battalion 14B were allegedly subjected by their superiors to violent hazing in the afternoon of Feb. 6 after they completed training for basic internal security operations at Camp Brig. Gen. Salipada K. Pendatun in Parang, Maguindanao del Norte.

Initial investigation by the PNP regional office showed that the recruits were ordered to duck-walk and roll on the ground and were punched, slapped and assaulted with wooden sticks.

The PNP has sacked the entire 70-plus members of Battalion 14B as administrative and possible criminal proceedings are initiated against them.

Twelve non-commissioned officers of the battalion were positively identified by the recruits. Investigation also tagged five corporals and five patrolmen along with several still unidentified participants in the hazing.

RA 11053 intended to give teeth to the original Anti-Hazing Act that was passed in 1995, RA 8049. RA 11053 imposes the maximum penalties of life in prison and a fine of up to P3 million for participants in hazing. Yet violent initiation rites continue to be reported in the two sources of the officer corps in the police – the PNP Academy and Philippine Military Academy.

Police recruits who are subjected by their superiors to an orgy of violence can easily believe that cruelty and the wanton use of force are the norm in law enforcement.

As the recruits move up in the PNP, this mindset makes it easier to resort to extrajudicial short cuts in police operations – something that the nation saw in the bloody crackdown on suspected drug offenders during the Duterte administration.

In the case of the alleged hazing in the Bangsamoro region, the issue is complicated by reports that the recruits are former members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, who were integrated into the PNP in line with the peace agreement with the separatist group.

A positive aspect of this story is that the PNP acted quickly and relieved the suspected perpetrators. With cops themselves breaking the law against hazing, it’s little wonder that its enforcement is a joke.
