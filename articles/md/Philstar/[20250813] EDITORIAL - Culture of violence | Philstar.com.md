For some time now, there has been talk about implementing measures to curb bullying and deadly violence in schools. Two months into the new school year, however, the measures are still awaited in many areas.

This month in Balabagan, Lanao del Sur, a teenage senior high school student shot dead his teacher who had given him a failing grade in an exam. Danilo Barba died inside the campus of the Balabagan Trade School after being shot with a caliber .45 pistol. The killer went into hiding, but surrendered the next day with the help of his brother, a policeman.

In Santa Rosa, Nueva Ecija, a 15-year-old student remains in critical condition in a hospital after being shot by her former boyfriend in a classroom at the Santa Rosa Integrated School. The teenage boy shot himself with the caliber .22 handgun after the incident and died later.

Last month, video footage showed two Grade 9 students beating up a 15-year-old Grade 10 student inside the premises of the Basilan National High School in Isabela City. The two were reportedly trying to force the victim to do something against his will.

In April this year, two 15-year-old Grade 8 students were stabbed dead by fellow teenage students over a minor incident in school. The victims were attacked as they were leaving the school in Barangay CAA in Las Piñas.

Earlier, in March, a 14-year-old Grade 8 student at Moonwalk National High School in Parañaque was stabbed to death with a kitchen knife by a fellow student who complained of being constantly bullied by classmates. The girl had reportedly refused to lend her make-up kit to the suspect.

Results of the first two times that the Philippines participated in the Program for International Student Assessment cited bullying as a major reason for the dismal PISA performance of Filipino 15-year-olds. The study described the Philippines as the “bullying capital of the world.”

Obviously, it’s hard to focus on learning when a student faces the prospect of being beaten up or, worse, shot or stabbed dead right inside the school campus. Digital technology has allowed bullies to continue harassing their victims even at their home.

The government is reportedly deploying barangay personnel to guard schools. Greater effort is needed to keep guns out of the hands of teens. And deeper intervention is needed to curb bullying, violence and the mental health problems arising from or fueling the attacks.
