From the outset, controversy had hounded the artificial beach constructed along the baywalk area in the city of Manila.

In the latest controversy, the dolomite beach was recently blamed by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority for exacerbating flooding in the metropolis. The MMDA, which handles flood control including the flood pumping stations in Metro Manila, said the beach clogged drainage systems.

The beach made of dolomite was laid out in the previous administration ostensibly in compliance with a writ of kalikasan issued by the Supreme Court, requiring multiple executive agencies led by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to clean up and rehabilitate Manila Bay.

Reacting to the MMDA statement, the DENR said climate change was to blame for serious flooding in the metropolis, which caused a “striking” increase in rainfall over the past decade. The DENR called for a “science-based analysis” of the flooding problem.

Critics saw the dolomite project as an expensive cosmetic effort even as the Duterte administration approved several reclamation projects all over the bay that have since been blamed for massive flooding from Bulacan to Cavite.

Even as people later enjoyed the only “white beach” in Metro Manila, critics also lamented that the fenced off area obstructed the view of the bay and its famed sunset from Roxas Boulevard.

Critics also questioned the construction of a new multi-story building at bayside, disregarding easement rules, which became the office of the DENR and other agencies tasked to supervise the high-maintenance dolomite beach and the bay clean-up.

Reacting to the MMDA’s observation, a lawmaker is proposing a congressional review of the dolomite beach project. Regardless of the outcome of this proposal, multiple agencies must take a closer look at the drainage system and flood control program in Metro Manila. If the dolomite beach is part of the problem, authorities must do something about it.

A combination of climate change, clogged drainage and inadequate flood control facilities likely contributed to worsening flooding. Floods may not be prevented, but they can at least be made to subside faster and diverted, minimizing disruptions and damage.
