Another broadcaster has been added to the ever-growing list of journalist killings in the country.

Erwin “Boy Pana” Segovia was reportedly driving home on his motorcycle after hosting his public affairs radio program yesterday morning when he was shot in the head by two assailants on another motorcycle in Barangay Mangagoy in Bislig City, Surigao del Sur. The assailants got away.

A total of P2 million has been offered as a reward for information leading to the arrest of the killers of Segovia, the 63-year-old station manager of Radyo Gugma.

Of the amount, P1 million was offered by former Cantilan town mayor Carla Lopez Pichay. The other P1 million was put up by her political opponents, Rep. Alexander Pimentel, who defeated Pichay in the race last May for the 2nd congressional district of Surigao del Sur, and his brother, Surigao Gov. Johnny Pimentel.

There are insinuations that Segovia might have gotten entangled in the rivalry between the two clans. This can only be established if the killers are caught.

Regardless of the motivation, every murder must be solved with the arrest, prosecution and punishment of those behind the crime – both the triggerman and the mastermind together with accomplices who assist in the actual killing as well as those who help cover it up.

Failure to catch and prosecute murderers has consistently placed the Philippines among the 10 most dangerous countries for media workers. Since the restoration of democracy in 1986, over 200 journalists have been murdered in the Philippines, according to media groups.

The Philippines also ranked ninth in the 2024 Impunity Index drawn up by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, which tracks countries where journalist murders are unsolved.

In many of the killings, local political warlords are suspected as the brains. The kingpins typically control the pillars of the criminal justice system in their turfs, which allows them to get away with murder, literally.

The worst single deadly attack on journalists, which claimed the lives of 32 media workers, was carried out in November 2009 by the Ampatuan clan because a rival dared to challenge their political stranglehold on Maguindanao province.

In March 2023, political rivalry was also blamed for the assassination of Negros Oriental governor Roel Degamo inside his residence in Pamplona, with the daring raid claiming the lives of nine other people in the compound. The accused mastermind, expelled congressman Arnolfo Teves Jr., has claimed innocence.

Impunity can only end if killers are caught and punished. The government must show that crime does not pay.
