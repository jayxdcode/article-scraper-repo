Japan is pushing through with its official development assistance supporting over P800 billion worth of infrastructure projects in the Philippines, the Department of Finance has announced. Japan is the Philippines’ largest source of ODA.

Finance officials have also denied the report about a P28.7-billion ODA loan for a Philippine project that was supposedly canceled by the South Korean government over corruption concerns, stressing that Seoul is not financing the project.

Meanwhile, the US government has announced the approval of a $250-million grant to finance various Philippine health care programs and projects.

The European Union, for its part, has expressed support for ongoing efforts to address corruption in the Philippines, currently focused on flood control projects.

So foreign aid to the Philippines will continue amid the corruption scandal. But the revelations about the extent of corruption in public works alone could affect future ODA programs, particularly in infrastructure development.

Several countries particularly in Europe have strict laws and rules barring even their private companies from engaging in corrupt practices anywhere in the world. They have equally tight laws and rules governing the allotment and utilization of their aid overseas.

The Philippines remains heavily reliant on ODA for many of its development needs, and it cannot afford to ignore the anti-corruption rules in the donor countries.

Much will depend on the way the problem will be addressed. Investigations are underway, with one by an independent commission expected to start soon. Filipinos are expecting speedy prosecution and punishment of those who have stolen an estimated trillions of pesos in public funds, with no sacred cows spared.

Equally important is the implementation of enduring structural reforms, which should address corruption in other government offices. Everyone believes corruption taints many other agencies, affecting the delivery of public services and the quality of projects.

The flood control scandal has also exposed the holes in the control of money laundering through the casinos. Revelations about the district engineers sacked from the Department of Public Works and Highways have shown how easy it is to launder dirty money through the casinos. As the probes have indicated, they continued doing it even as cataclysmic floods inundated Metro Manila, Bulacan and other parts of Luzon in the past weeks.

Unless decisively addressed, this scandal could return the Philippines to the gray list of countries under close monitoring for money laundering by the Financial Action Task Force.

Apart from confronting Filipinos’ outrage over the theft of trillions in public funds, the government must reassure its international partners that their aid is not being misused.
