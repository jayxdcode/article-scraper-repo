Nearly two years after providing sanctuary to Arnolfo Teves Jr., the government of Timor-Leste had an epiphany and decided that his continued stay in that country is a threat to national security and an affront to Timorese interests and dignity.

Yesterday afternoon, Timor-Leste finally granted the petition of the Philippine government and deported Teves. The former Negros Oriental congressman was put on a Philippine Air Force plane that was sent to Timor-Leste to bring him back to the Philippines where he is wanted – as Dili pointed out – for 13 counts of murder and 17 counts of frustrated murder between 2019 and 2023.

Among those cases was the massacre in March 2023 of 10 people led by former Negros Oriental governor Roel Degamo at his residential compound in Pamplona town. Degamo’s widow Janice is the newly elected representative of Negros Oriental’s third district, beating Teves’ aunt Janice Teves and retired Navy colonel Reynaldo Lopez.

More than her election victory, Janice Degamo has been seeking justice for her husband and the others slain with him, with Teves as the accused mastermind.

The wheels of justice have been moving slowly over two years as Teves evaded capture. In September 2023, he was located in Timor-Leste, where he is said to enjoy the friendship of certain officials. Timorese authorities arrested him last year while he was enjoying a round of golf, but he was later released.

This time, his lawyers managed to secure late in the evening of May 28 a writ of habeas corpus from Timor-Leste’s Court of Appeal, which ordered Dili authorities to produce Teves in court. But the Dili government brushed aside the court order and sent Teves back to the Philippines yesterday.

It is now up to the Philippine government to show that the wheels of justice will turn quickly even as Teves is accorded due process, as Manila has committed to Dili in seeking his expulsion from Timor-Leste.

Teves’ arrest once again shows what international cooperation can do in bringing fugitives to justice. There are numerous other fugitives being sought by the Philippine government for serious crimes including large-scale drug trafficking, qualified human trafficking and cyberscams. Teves’ expulsion shows that the arm of the law can be long, with a little help from friends.
