Politicians aren’t the only targets of assassination in this election season; journalists continue to be targeted for murder.

The latest victim is Juan “Johnny” Dayang. The veteran journalist, 89, was reportedly watching television at home in Aklan on Tuesday night when a man walked in and shot him. The gunman fled on a motorcycle. Dayang was a newspaper columnist who served as interim mayor of Aklan’s capital town Kalibo shortly after the 1986 people power revolt. He was pronounced dead on arrival in a hospital.

This brazenness in committing murder springs from the weakness of the state in bringing killers to justice. Filipinos and foreigners alike have been killed with impunity, with the assailants captured in only a few cases, and with even fewer suspects convicted and sent to prison.

Dayang’s murder will be added to the ever-growing list of journalists killed in the Philippines, making the country one of the most dangerous places in the world for media workers. If his killer remains scot-free, the case will contribute to the country’s high ranking in the global Impunity Index that is drawn up annually by the Committee to Protect Journalists.

The Iloilo Media-Citizen Council condemned Dayang’s murder, lamenting in a statement: “No one is safe, not even the elderly, not even those who have long stepped away from the daily grind.”

“His cold-blooded murder inside his own home – where he should have been safest – marks a new low in the attacks against journalists and media workers in this country,” the council declared.

Dayang was in fact not the first journalist to be shot dead at home. In November 2023, Juan Jumalon, known as DJ Johnny Walker, was shot dead while livestreaming his program from his home-based radio station in Calamba town, Misamis Occidental. The gunman had walked into the house, pretending to be a listener, and later fled on a motorcycle driven by a companion.

Three suspects were arrested for the murder of Jumalon. But on March 18 this year, Calamba Regional Trial Court Judge Michael Ajoc cleared the three for lack of evidence and ordered them freed.

A murder cannot be considered solved until the killer has been caught, convicted with finality and punished.  Until there is some certainty of killers getting caught and brought to justice, Juan Dayang won’t be the last journalist to be murdered.
