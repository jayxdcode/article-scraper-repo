When he was secretary of justice under the Marcos administration, Jesus Crispin Remulla had urged members of the Philippine National Police to come out and talk about extrajudicial killings or EJK and other abuses in the conduct of the war on drugs waged during the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte.

Remulla later said some feelers were sent about the possibility of certain PNP members taking up the offer. He promised protection for those interested, as he noted the difficulty of building cases in the Philippines against those who may be held accountable for the abuses of the drug war, in the absence of eyewitnesses or direct participants who might be willing to talk.

The feelers were not followed up, and Remulla was later named ombudsman. But the appeal for cooperation from the PNP has been renewed, this time by the International Criminal Court, which has Duterte in its custody at the ICC prison in The Hague.

The ICC is investigating allegations of EJK, torture and sexual violence as possible crimes against humanity committed in Duterte’s brutal anti-drug crackdown, from November 2011 when he served as vice mayor and mayor of Davao City until March 19, 2019 during his presidency.

Several reports point to one or two former top lieutenants of Duterte who may also face arrest by the ICC. In heeding the ICC’s call for cooperation, PNP members not only can help bring justice to victims of the drug war, but also save themselves from criminal indictments in case they are implicated in the ICC probe.

The country has withdrawn from the Rome Statute. The PNP spokesman has pointed out that cops cannot be compelled to cooperate with the ICC, but those who want to do so will not be stopped. Cooperation can be done through the ICC’s digital portal.

The PNP may have to do more so that police participants or eyewitnesses in the drug war will not be scared to talk to the ICC. As they will be testifying against fellow police officers, those who want to break their silence will need some form of state protection from retaliation, and assurance that their jobs will not be jeopardized.

President Marcos had allowed Duterte’s turnover to the ICC through the Interpol. For the President, there is no turning back on this unprecedented move, which deserves a sustained follow-through.
