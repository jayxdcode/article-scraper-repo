With each passing day, more dismaying details about the flood control scandal are revealed.

Last Tuesday, sacked assistant district engineer Brice Hernandez told the Senate Blue Ribbon committee that since 2019, all projects carried out by the Department of Public Works and Highways in Bulacan’s first engineering district have been substandard, to accommodate kickbacks of lawmakers and other government officials.

The projects include not only flood control interventions but also roads, classrooms, hospitals, bridges and even street lighting, Hernandez testified.

This was only in one DPWH engineering district. How widespread was this vile practice?

Among the many questions still waiting for an answer is how crooks managed to pass off substandard or non-existent flood control projects as completed.

With so many people on the government payroll, didn’t anyone bother checking project implementation? At the start of a project, the government representatives at the grassroots – the barangay officials – should at least be aware that a flooding intervention is supposed to be carried out. Such projects, after all, are meant to benefit the community.

At various stages of implementation, shouldn’t there be performance audits? This is what several donors of official development assistance do, deploying inspectors to ODA-financed projects typically every quarter before releasing the funds in tranches.

Before a project is declared completed, government auditors are supposed to check the project and sign off on the completion.

But now we’re getting an inkling of what happened to the performance audits. Among the contractors of flood control projects in Bulacan is Olympus Mining and Builders Group Philippines Corp. Its president and general manager is Marilou Laurio-Lipana, who happens to be the wife of Commission on Audit Commissioner Mario Lipana.

The COA official, according to sacked Bulacan district engineer Henry Alcantara, inserted flood control projects in Bulacan amounting to P500 million in 2023, P400 million in 2024 and P500 million in 2025.

A fact-finding probe on the Lipana couple is now reportedly being carried out by the Office of the Ombudsman for possible criminal prosecution. Since COA commissioners are impeachable officials, there are proposals to remove Lipana by impeachment.

As of yesterday, there was no comment from the COA regarding Lipana. He may opt to go on indefinite leave, out of delicadeza. But if the accusations against him are true, delicadeza would be alien to him.

How deep is the rot in the COA? Its personnel are tasked to audit all government agencies. Their failure to carry out their mandate must be addressed ASAP.
