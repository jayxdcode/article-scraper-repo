Is it weak capacity or a deliberate act of omission on the part of state auditors, of looking the other way in the face of anomalies in government?

This question has cropped up as more anomalous projects, mostly under the Department of Public Works and Highways, continue to be uncovered. All DPWH and local infrastructure projects are supposed to undergo auditing.

The Commission on Audit has personnel all over the country. All these years, were many of them sleeping in the pansitan or noodle house, or did not know how to do their job properly? Or are they like those ghost employees in the offices of two former Monetary Board members – now happily resigned and their cases safely swept under the rug – who were paid fat salaries every 15 days?

A number of the state auditors might have deliberately looked the other way, perhaps inspired by their superior, Commissioner Mario Lipana, who together with his contractor wife Marilou have been implicated in anomalous flood control projects.

Apart from substandard and non-existent or ghost projects meant for flood control, similar anomalies have been detected in farm-to-market roads, classrooms and school buildings, public health facilities and patchwork road repairs.

It now almost seems as if every project involving DPWH construction is treated as an opportunity for stealing public funds. Projects are overpriced, or else specifications are not followed and cheaper goods and services procured to make room for kickbacks.

In worse cases, projects are never carried out. And the worst is when the same ghost projects are proposed and approved in the national budget and funded over and over, every fiscal year.

Various sectors have pointed out that the trillions lost to corruption could have erased the classroom backlog, boosted public access to proper health care and provided decent housing for the poor. Teachers and nurses would get better pay and need not leave for greener pastures overseas. The amounts stolen could have built all the roads needed in Metro Manila so that the private sector need not step in and provide roads with steep tolls that raise logistics costs and contribute to inflation.

And yes, lives would have been saved and billions in public infrastructure, crops and private property protected if flood control projects had been properly implemented.

Who audits the auditors? As of June this year, the Commission on Audit reportedly had 8,820 employees. They must reassure the dismayed citizenry that the competent and honest in the COA outnumber the rotten eggs.
