The administration started out so gung-ho about transparency, accountability and putting thieves behind bars, with officials trumpeting that there would be no sacred cows in the probe on the flood control and budget scandal.

So the administration should not be surprised if it is perceived to have slammed on the brakes now that the corruption trail appears to lead to the doorsteps of people close to President Marcos.

Days after former Department of Public Works and Highways undersecretary Maria Catalina Cabral fell to her death from a cliff in Benguet, Batangas Rep. Leandro Leviste had announced that he had in his possession her files showing all the lawmakers and other officials who had insertions and “allocables” in the DPWH budget for 2025.

Leviste said he would release the files if DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon, who supposedly knew about the files, would give the green light. Days passed with no comment from Dizon, although the DPWH announced that it had turned over files from Cabral’s office to the ombudsman.

The files were then released by Leviste, showing relatives of the President to be among the biggest DPWH project proponents. Malacañang said that unless authenticated by the DPWH, the files would be nothing but “hearsay” lacking probative value.

So how hard would it be for the DPWH to authenticate the files, or conclusively debunk them as fake?

Over the weekend, Dizon said he had not yet seen Leviste’s so-called Cabral files and therefore could not vouch for their authenticity. Dizon also said that Leviste obtained the files without permission from Cabral’s office computer through a staffer.

Yesterday, following up on Dizon’s statement, Malacañang sought a probe on how Leviste obtained the files, which the congressman previously said was provided by the DPWH with Dizon’s approval.

Senate President Pro Tempore Panfilo Lacson said that prior to her death, Cabral had offered to testify fully at the Senate about the files. Lacson said DPWH files showed that at least five Cabinet secretaries and several undersecretaries had billions in “allocables” and “non-allocables” in the 2025 national budget. It is unclear if Lacson and Leviste are referring to the same files.

Based on what he has seen, Lacson said former DPWH secretary Manuel Bonoan, whose whereabouts are now unknown, had at least P30.5 billion in allocables while a certain “ES” had P8.3 billion. The other Cabinet secretaries received P2 billion each, Lacson said.

Lacson is correct in asking why even executive officials should have allocables, or funds that can be deployed for projects or programs earmarked by the officials. It’s a legitimate question that deserves an answer from the administration, along with clarity on the so-called Cabral files.
