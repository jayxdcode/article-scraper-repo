What does Malacañang intend to do with the Independent Commission for Infrastructure? This question has grown louder as former public works secretary Rogelio Singson left the ICI yesterday, ostensibly because the work was taking its toll on his body.

The ICI can initiate on its own probes into corruption involving flood control and other infrastructure projects. But the ICI is woefully undermanned and underfunded, and it has mainly been forwarding recommendations to either the Office of the Ombudsman or the Department of Justice on who should face prosecution in the flood control mess.

Singson submitted his letter of irrevocable resignation to Malacañang on Nov. 14. The Palace did not reply, and to this day has not announced a possible replacement.

The resignation became final as speculation swirled that another ICI commissioner is set to quit: Rossana Fajardo, a certified public accountant and country managing director of auditing firm SGV & Co.

This would leave retired Supreme Court associate justice Andres Reyes Jr. all by his lonesome as ICI chairman and commissioner.

In late September, Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong became the first to quit the ICI, after getting word from Malacañang that he was merely a special adviser and not an investigator of the commission. He was replaced by former national police chief Rodolfo Azurin Jr.

Magalong recently indicated that Fajardo also wanted to quit and return to her work as auditor in the private sector. The mayor explained that ICI members had been made to believe that the work of the fact-finding body, formed as public outrage exploded over corruption in flood control, would take only a few months.

As of yesterday, the word from the ICI was that it would focus on case buildups, with no further hearings set this holiday season. That sounds more like a body winding up its work.

Since Jesus Crispin Remulla became ombudsman, the Palace enthusiasm for the ICI appears to have flagged. Remulla recently said the ICI was good for just one or two more months.

Malacañang should clarify what its plans are for the ICI. If Remulla is correct in his reading of a phaseout of the ICI, the Palace should move to bolster the capacity of the prosecution service and judiciary to handle the expected flood of criminal and administrative cases in connection with the corruption scandal.

The Sandiganbayan can use more courts or divisions while the ombudsman needs more offices or expanded capacity particularly in the Visayas and Mindanao. If the executive is serious in its anti-corruption campaign, it must boost legal capacity for its crackdown.
