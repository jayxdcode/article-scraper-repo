The Department of the Interior and Local Government has ordered officials of local government units to take down all materials featuring their names and images on state-funded property, projects and programs. The DILG order covers all LGU officials down to the barangay.

DILG Secretary Jonvic Remulla has warned that those caught defying the order will face administrative sanctions for violating the anti-epal provision in the 2026 General Appropriations Act. Among others, the GAA bars politicians from claiming personal credit for state-funded infrastructure, projects and aid programs.

The Department of Social Welfare and Development, which administers the bulk of ayuda programs that politicians have used for self-promotion, has maintained that there is already such a prohibition in place. Obviously, that prohibition has not been implemented, necessitating an anti-epal provision in the GAA.

Now it turns out that the DILG had issued an anti-epal order to all LGU officials way back in September 2010, Memorandum Circular No. 2010-101.

In January 2013, the Commission on Audit backed this with a broader prohibition – Circular 2013-004 – covering both national and local officials as well as all government agency heads including the managers of government-owned and controlled corporations.

Last December, the COA cited the two circulars in flagging millions of pesos worth of supplies and equipment procured by the provincial government of Camarines Sur.

The COA audit report said the items included 1,000 laptops worth P34.45 million for public school teachers, water containers with faucets worth P18.37 million, portable speakers with karaoke function worth P20.6 million, outdoor vests for barangay watchmen, wheeled trash bins worth P1.45 million and basketball backboards. The items, according to the COA report, bore the name, initials, markings or logos associated with Gov. Luigi Villafuerte.

That’s a lot of items for self-promotion charged to taxpayers by just one person. But the practice is widespread across the country, mainly because enforcement of anti-epal circulars has been almost non-existent.

Taxpayers can only hope that the COA’s action in Camarines Sur is being carried out nationwide, and that violators are penalized sufficiently. The COA must also coordinate with the DILG and the Office of the Ombudsman for further punitive action. Epal has thrived because all the rules against it have been a joke.
