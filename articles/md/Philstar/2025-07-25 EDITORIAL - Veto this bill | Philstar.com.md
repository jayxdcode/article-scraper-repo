Despite a Supreme Court ruling peppered with the word “unconstitutional,” the 19th Congress managed to pass before its end yet another measure seeking to again postpone by a year the barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections scheduled in December this year.

President Marcos can still veto the enrolled bill, which seeks to give BSK officials a term of four years – longer than those of congressmen and elected local government executives.

The call for a veto was made by election lawyer Romulo Macalintal, whose petition against the postponement of the BSKE in 2022 was granted by the Supreme Court. That ruling by the SC said prolonged postponements of the BSKE, which effectively gave the BSK officials a term extension of at least a year, were “unduly arbitrary or oppressive of the electorate’s right of suffrage.”

In declaring the law postponing the BSKE unconstitutional, the SC found “no legitimate government interest or objective” to support the measure. The Commission on Elections has also cited the billions of pesos in additional expenses to taxpayers each time the BSKE is postponed for a prolonged period.

Macalintal pointed out that the same arguments are being trotted out in the latest bill, backed mostly by the same lawmakers including President Marcos’ elder sister, who have repeatedly pushed for BSKE postponements.

With the SC already issuing a ruling declaring that such prolonged postponements violate the constitutionally guaranteed right of suffrage, signing the latest measure could open the President to accusations of culpable violation of the Constitution, which is an impeachable offense.

This scenario cannot be completely ruled out these days, considering the politically charged atmosphere in the country.

In case the President signs the measure or allows it to lapse into law, it is expected to face a similar challenge before the Supreme Court, filed by Macalintal perhaps together with other petitioners tired of the periodic attempts by lawmakers to pander to their grassroots political operators.

The President must put his foot down and veto the bill.
