What do politicians have against solo parents?

On the heels of lewd statements directed at single mothers by a congressional candidate in Pasig who thinks he’s God’s gift to women, another candidate, this time for mayor of Silang, Cavite, has been ordered to explain his derogatory remarks about solo parents.

Kevin Anarna, who is seeking reelection as mayor of Silang, also poked fun at grandmothers. In a campaign rally on March 29, he said grandmas liked pinching his butt, with one smothering him with kisses.

He also promised to pair off single parents with widows and widowers, with him presiding as mayor at their weddings.

Both Anarna and Pasig bet Christian Sia are lawyers, who obtained their pre-law degrees from the same exclusive university run by a religious order, where respect for women is supposed to be taught.

In another gender-related campaign controversy, a candidate seeking reelection as governor of Misamis Oriental said scholarships would be given to nurses, but only those who are good-looking. The comment of Peter Unabia has drawn rebuke from nurses’ organizations, along with an order from the Commission on Elections for an explanation on why he should not be disqualified for his sexist remarks.

Last year, Anarna was suspended for six months by the Office of the Ombudsman over anomalies in the procurement of flowers and other materials for the fiesta in Silang. Before the lapse of the six months, the ombudsman ordered his dismissal. With this order on appeal, Anarna can still run for reelection.

But he can be disqualified by the Comelec for violating rules on fair campaigning. And like Sia, Anarna can face criminal charges for violating laws against gender-based harassment and psychological abuse of women.

The controversies at least have prompted the Comelec to draw up additional guidelines on fair campaigning, which will protect women and vulnerable sectors from discriminatory and insulting remarks from candidates.

Election campaigns, the Comelec said, must be “safe spaces” with no room for gender discrimination. Lawyers, who are supposed to have sufficient education, are expected to show exemplary behavior in complying with campaign rules and showing respect for women.

Instead Sia and Anarna are dragging public discourse down to the gutter. The Comelec must do what it can to prevent such disgraceful conduct from aggravating the sorry state of Philippine politics.
