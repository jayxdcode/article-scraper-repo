The country has several laws against corruption, and two laws to cut red tape and promote ease of doing business. The Philippines is a signatory to the legally binding United Nations Convention Against Corruption, and ratified the international agreement way back in Nov. 6, 2006.

Yet corruption remains the top concern of business executives in the Philippines this year. This is according to the latest survey of the Management Association of the Philippines, conducted among the businessmen whose activities generate jobs and livelihood opportunities. The MAP survey, taken in the fourth quarter of 2024, also identified education, dealing with local government units, ease of doing business, the economy, climate change and cybersecurity among the top concerns of businesses.

Concerns over red tape especially at the local government level had prompted the enactment of Republic Act 9485, the Anti-Red Tape Act of 2007. As in most laws, however, there was a yawning gap between the enactment and enforcement of RA 9485. Over a decade later, another law had to be passed. RA 11032 or the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act was enacted in 2018. Still, not even the iron-fist approach to governance of Rodrigo Duterte, who often stressed in his speeches the need to cut red tape, could deliver the promised ease of doing business.

Surveys have shown that the country remains a regional laggard in terms of ease of doing business. This is undoubtedly among the factors that have made the country a laggard as well in terms of attracting foreign investments. Foreign firms that are now decamping from China are relocating not to the Philippines but to Vietnam and other destinations in Southeast Asia.

MAP and other groups in the private sector have been forging partnerships with the government to assist in sectors such as public education, health care and food production to promote the welfare of the countryâ€™s most precious resource, its people. But the government, with its resources, cannot depend too much on the private sector for the delivery of basic services. It must implement the necessary reforms and officials must lead by example in addressing the concerns of the business community.
