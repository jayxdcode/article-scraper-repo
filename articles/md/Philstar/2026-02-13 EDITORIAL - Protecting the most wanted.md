As of yesterday, the reward dangled by the government for information leading to the arrest of fugitive gambling tycoon Charlie “Atong” Ang had doubled to P20 million.

A common reaction to this report, which unfortunately may not be a joke, was that Ang had also doubled to P200 million the amount he is paying to those who are protecting him from arrest.

Ang can’t possibly be evading arrest all by his lonesome. Every effort must be made not only to find him, but also to ferret out those who are providing him protection. They can’t be doing so, risking arrest and criminal prosecution, simply out of love for Atong Ang.

The fugitive is wanted for multiple serious offenses, for the kidnapping, illegal detention and suspected murder of at least 34 cockfighting enthusiasts who went missing between April 2021 and January 2022.

About a dozen members of the Philippine National Police have been arrested and charged for several of the kidnappings with homicide targeting the sabungeros, who were reportedly suspected of rigging cockfights operated by Ang. Probers said some of the losing bettors were PNP members.

While there is no record of Ang leaving the country since the courts ordered his arrest, other high-profile wanted persons such as former Bamban mayor Alice Guo managed to sneak out of the country without official documentation.

Government officials said Ang had set up gambling operations in Cambodia before he became a fugitive. But Cambodia recently informed the Philippine government that Ang is not in that country, where local law enforcers have been conducting raids on illegal gambling, cyberscam and human trafficking hubs.

The presumption at this point is that Ang is still in the Philippines, enjoying the protection of people who are likely plugged into the network of those tasked to conduct the manhunt.

If ever Ang is caught, these protectors must be identified and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. And they must not be allowed to enjoy the profits of providing protection to a man wanted for heinous offenses.
