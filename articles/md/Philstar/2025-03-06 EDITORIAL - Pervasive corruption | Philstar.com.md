A special committee of the United Nations has just released the results of a review, stating what is a common perception in the Philippines – that “corruption remains pervasive in all branches of government and the wider public sector” in the country.

The review, released on Feb. 18 in Geneva, Switzerland, was meant to assess the implementation in the Philippines of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

The UN committee on the covenant took note of the information provided by Philippine authorities on efforts to fight corruption, including recently enacted laws and policy interventions. But it added: “…the committee remains concerned that the direct application of the Covenant by domestic courts, particularly lower courts, continues to remain low.”

It expressed concern about reports of public officials using pressure, threats, intimidation and intervention at all levels of the judicial system. The committee also expressed concern about the insufficiency of financial and technical resources for anti-corruption bodies such as the Commission on Audit and Office of the Ombudsman to carry out their mandate.

The Office of the Ombudsman, however, suffers from other institutional weaknesses and is only as efficient as its head, and the incumbent, unfortunately for the nation, has been underwhelming.

In its report, the UN committee recommended that the Philippines “safeguard, in law and in practice, the full independence, impartiality and safety of judges and prosecutors and prevent them from being influenced in their decision-making by any form of undue political pressure, violence, threats or corruption.”

Political intervention in the Philippine judicial system starts at the appointment process, with lawmakers having more than a ministerial role in the nomination, and religious and other special interest groups actively moving to influence the process.

Upon appointment, members of the judiciary as well as the prosecution service also turn to politicians for support in promotions and appointments. Even as they approach retirement, the decisions of justices and judges may be influenced by a desire for appointment by the Philippine president to a board seat in a government corporation, for example, or to a constitutional body.

Political influence in the legal system is apart from the “pervasive corruption” noted by the UN committee. It has recommended that the Philippines “promptly, independently and impartially investigate and prosecute all cases of corruption, in particular high-level corruption, including corruption in the government and the judiciary, and if a person is convicted, apply penalties commensurate with the seriousness of the offense.”

Now, if only the recommendations would be heeded in the Philippines.
