Millions of Catholics are expected to flock to churches across the country today as the Lenten season kicks off with the traditional daubing of ashes on the foreheads of the faithful.

As the nation observes Ash Wednesday, an official of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines has a message that bears repeating. Directed at corrupt politicians and other public officials, the message from Fr. Jerome Secillano of the CBCP’s Public Affairs Committee called for abstinence or fasting from stealing public funds.

Many politicians are devout Catholics – or at least they make a show of being devout, having their photos taken while attending mass, celebrating fiestas dedicated to saints or attending other Church events.

Politicians have invoked Church teachings in asserting their positions on controversial issues such as family planning, sex education and absolute divorce. So perhaps they will listen to Church calls for abstaining from thievery in government.

The call of the CBCP is being issued as the Church steps up efforts to help in restoring integrity in public service. It is being issued amid the biggest corruption scandal faced by the nation since the first Marcos administration.

As investigations have indicated, politicians and bureaucrats have systematically plundered billions of pesos from state coffers, pocketing public funds that could have otherwise been used for the many urgent needs of the country.

The thievery, institutionalized in the budget process and the implementation of flood control and other public works projects, led to the loss of lives, livelihoods, crops and private property. Such thievery is evil, and the moral dimension deserves to be addressed along with the legal aspects.

Fasting from stealing must not be limited to the Lenten season; it must be a lifetime abstinence. After all, one of the Ten Commandments, as taught by the Church, is “Thou shall not steal.” Violation of the commandment can earn the sinner eternal damnation in the fires of hell.

A number of those accused of large-scale looting are of the age when they will soon be feeling their mortality. Perhaps the threat of eternal damnation will matter to them.
