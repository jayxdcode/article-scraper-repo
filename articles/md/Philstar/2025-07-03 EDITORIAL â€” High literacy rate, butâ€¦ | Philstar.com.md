And now for some good news: seven in 10 Filipinos age 10 to 64 are functionally literate while a high nine in 10 can read, write and perform basic mathematics.

This is according to the 2024 Functional Literacy, Education and Mass Media Survey released yesterday by the Philippine Statistics Authority. Citing the FLEMMS, the PSA said 90 percent of Filipinos age five and older – around 93.09 million out of the latest population count of 103.46 million  – have basic literacy skills. These refer to the ability to read and write with comprehension a simple message in a language or dialect, and to carry out basic math.

On the other hand, functional literacy, measured among ages 10 to 64, refers to higher-level skills in addition to reading, writing and computing, such as drawing inferences from text and integrating information. The FLEMMS indicated that about 60.17 million out of 85 million Filipinos age 10 to 64 can read, write, compute and comprehend written information.

While the literacy rates may seem encouraging at first glance, however, the study also showed that 6.9 percent of Filipinos age five and older remain illiterate. That’s a rather high percentage of people who cannot read, write or perform basic arithmetic.

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao posted the highest rate of illiteracy among the regions at 14.4 percent. This complicates efforts to lift the BARMM from its current status as the poorest region in the country.

The highest rate of illiteracy, at 20.1 percent, was also registered in the five to nine age group, which are the critical formative years in learning.

A significant gap was noted between basic and functional literacy, with the gap widest in the 60 to 64 age group, the PSA also noted.

And despite the high basic and functional literacy rates, there is still national dismay over the results of the first two times that the country participated in the Program for International Student Assessment. The PISA results showed Filipino 15-year-old students ranking at the bottom of their peers in mathematics, science and reading competencies.

The nation is still awaiting the results of the third time that the country participated in the PISA, which is administered by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Several problems have been cited for the poor PISA performance of the Filipino students. Apart from the problems that have long been identified by education stakeholders such as the lack of classrooms, school supplies and qualified teachers as well as poor nutrition, the PISA also noted the high cases of bullying in Philippine schools.

High literacy rates cannot lull stakeholders into complacency. Philippine education is in crisis and needs urgent attention.
