For the first time in years, the days for remembering the dearly departed are being marked as relatives of the thousands who were killed in the brutal crackdown on illegal drugs feel they are a step closer to attaining justice.

Last March, the unapologetic leader of that crackdown was flown to The Hague in the Netherlands, where he is likely to face trial before the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity in connection with his bloody war on drugs. The ICC recently dismissed a challenge to its jurisdiction over the case against former president Rodrigo Duterte. The dismissal is on appeal, but legal experts say the ICC is unlikely to reverse itself.

Lawyers knowledgeable about ICC procedures say at least two former Duterte officials directly involved in the war on drugs are expected to face arrest orders, to be coursed by the ICC through the International Criminal Police Organization.

That will leave many other public officials, from law enforcement down to the barangays, without accountability for the killing of thousands of people who were shot mainly on suspicion of involvement in the illegal drug trade – unless the Marcos administration takes the lead in holding accountable those who might have been complicit in extrajudicial killings.

Compared with the previous administration, the current one has shown noteworthy improvements in fighting the illegal drug scourge. Its record is not perfect – drug trafficking is big money and the dealers are armed and ready for violence, often making lethal encounters unavoidable.

Still, there have been fewer complaints about state abuses and the excessive use of force, particularly against suspects from underprivileged communities. There are greater efforts to regard drug abuse as a public health problem rather than a law enforcement issue.

Today, All Saints’ Day, and on All Souls’ Day tomorrow, relatives of the thousands of drug war victims, most of whom were killed ostensibly for resisting arrest or nanlaban, have reason to look forward to a day of reckoning in their quest for justice.

Last Oct. 1, 15 senators approved a resolution asking the ICC to place Duterte under house arrest for “humanitarian considerations.” The ICC later junked a formal appeal by Duterte’s camp for his interim release. But the Senate resolution indicates how nearly impossible it would be to hold Duterte accountable in the Philippines, where he continues to wield considerable political clout, and why the ICC had to step in.

On these days for remembering the dead, recent developments give relatives of drug war victims reason to hope that their loved ones may one day be able to truly rest in peace.
