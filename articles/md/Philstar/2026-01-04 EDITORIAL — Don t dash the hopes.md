As in the past, a high percentage of Filipinos said in a survey that they were entering the new year with hope.

The survey taken by Social Weather Stations from Nov. 24 to 30, however, showed that the 89 percent was the lowest in 16 years, matching the 89 percent registered in December 2009. It was also a slip from the 90 percent in December 2024.

Those who said they were entering 2026 with fear also edged up to 11 percent from 10 percent in December 2024 – the same as the 11 percent in December 2009.

A survey conducted by another pollster should give an indication of the sources of slipping hopefulness. The survey taken from Dec. 12 to 15 by Pulse Asia showed a large majority of Filipinos disapproving of the way the administration is handling select national issues.

The administration received the highest disapproval rating of 69 percent in controlling inflation, with only percent expressing approval.

Fighting graft and corruption followed closely, with 68 percent expressing disapproval and 17 percent approving. After inflation and corruption, reducing poverty ranked third among the most urgent concerns, with 55 percent disapproving and 16 percent approving of the government’s handling of the issue.

Also with a high disapproval rating, at 67 percent, was the fight against the widespread sale and use of illegal drugs, with only 14 percent expressing approval.

Those behind the SWS and Pulse Asia polls have found it noteworthy that the fight against corruption has become a major concern for Filipinos. Previous surveys had consistently shown inflation and other economic issues as the dominant concerns.

The survey results indicate that Filipinos are seeing the deleterious impact of corruption on their lives, affecting matters related to their livelihoods, jobs, consumer prices and poverty levels.

As 2025 drew to a close, the administration suffered from perceptions that the anti-corruption campaign, launched by President Marcos with impressive flair, was faltering from realpolitik.

The survey results at the end of the year should serve as guideposts for the President. At the start of the year, the anti-corruption campaign needs reinvigoration, a reaffirmation of a sincere resolve to implement significant, long-term reforms.

Even if the surveys show slipping hopefulness, 89 percent is still a high number. Those hopes must not be dashed.
