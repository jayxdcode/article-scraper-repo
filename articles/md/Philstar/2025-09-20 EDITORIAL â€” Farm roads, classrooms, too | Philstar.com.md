At the rate details are coming to light about the operations of the Department of Public Works and Highways, the ranks of DPWH officials may be decimated in an ongoing purge.

Apart from substandard and non-existent flood control projects, the government is now looking at other infrastructure projects undertaken by the DPWH.

Last Thursday, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel announced an upcoming comprehensive audit of farm-to-market roads built by the DPWH from 2021 to 2025.

Apart from looking out for what Tiu Laurel described as “farm-to-pocket” projects, the audit should also determine if the roads were built mainly to benefit the properties of politicians instead of connecting farms to markets.

It would not be the first time that public funds meant for agriculture were diverted to the pockets of crooks in government. In March 2004, Sen. Panfilo Lacson exposed the release of P728 million in fertilizer funds to congressional districts, including those without farmlands, allegedly for the presidential campaign of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.

Prosecution of that corruption case has been spotty. Accused mastermind former agriculture undersecretary Jocelyn “Joc-joc” Bolante cleared Arroyo. Bolante was himself acquitted together with former agriculture chief Luis Lorenzo, former National Food Authority administrator Arthur Yap and one of the accused conduits for the diverted funds, Janet Lim Napoles.

Not all is lost though. Between January 2021 and July last year, several former local government officials have been convicted in connection with the scam. Several other cases are still pending.

The government can learn from this case in pursuing possible anomalies in the construction of farm-to-market roads.

Construction of school buildings and classrooms is also handled by the DPWH. Yesterday, Education Secretary Sonny Angara disclosed that a nationwide audit of all school infrastructure projects is underway.

This was after he learned that over 1,000 classrooms built by the DPWH were turned over unfinished to the Department of Education – lacking basic items including paint, electrical fixtures and water. While these are not ghost or non-existent projects, they are practically the same since they cannot be used, according to Angara.

Did the classroom projects run out of funds? Or, as in flood control projects, was there drastic cost-cutting to accommodate the costs of corruption? If this is the case and the practice is widespread, you can see why the DepEd has accumulated a backlog of 165,000 classrooms.

Whether due to corruption or incompetence, those in charge of subpar projects must be held accountable. And they must be pursued, before any effort to bring them to justice is again thrown out due to “inordinate delay.”
