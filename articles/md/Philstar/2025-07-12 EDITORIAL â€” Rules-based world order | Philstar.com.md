Nine years ago today, Filipinos erupted in jubilation after the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague not only defined the country’s sovereign rights and maritime entitlements within its 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone, but also invalidated China’s so-called nine-dash-line claim over nearly all of the South China Sea.

Although both the Philippines and China are signatories to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, on which the arbitration court based its ruling, Beijing has refused to bow to UNCLOS. It has created military-fortified artificial islands all over the South China Sea, including on Panganiban or Mischief Reef over which the arbitral court specifically awarded the Philippines sovereign rights.

The Philippines was compelled to turn to international arbitration after China announced in 2013 that it would be administering the Spratly island chain, Paracels and Macclesfield Bank from its southernmost province of Hainan. It then proceeded to block Filipinos’ entry to Panatag or Scarborough Shoal, including fishermen.

Facing an economic and military giant, the Philippines sought a definition of the country’s maritime entitlements under UNCLOS. China refused to participate in the arbitration. It has ignored retired Supreme Court senior associate justice Antonio Carpio’s observation that Beijing had inadvertently recognized, through “judicial admission,” Manila’s maritime claims in a 2014 position paper declaring that Philippine territory was bound by the 1898 Treaty of Paris and the 1900 Treaty of Washington. The 1900 treaty includes as part of the Philippines the areas in the West Philippine Sea being claimed by China.

In contrast to public jubilation over the arbitral award, the mood was funereal at Malacañang, with Rodrigo Duterte warning over and over during his presidency that the country could not afford to go to war with China. The Philippines, however, is not engaging in actual combat, but is engaging friends for support in enforcing international rules.

Those voices of support have increased in the past nine years, as China’s artificial island building intensified and a fifth column of sorts developed in the Philippines.

The supportive voices have consistently condemned China’s aggression in staking its maritime claims as well as the gray zone and hybrid warfare tactics that it has been employing. These tactics include blasting Philippine vessels with powerful water cannons and shining blinding laser lights at other countries’ aircraft.

The Philippines is aware of its limitations in enforcing sovereign rights and maritime entitlements with the use of military power. But nine years after the arbitral award, the Philippines is seeing the power of support for a global order anchored on international rules.
