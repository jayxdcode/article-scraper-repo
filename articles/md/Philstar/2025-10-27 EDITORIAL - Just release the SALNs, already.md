With the two highest officials of the land plus the Cabinet leading the reluctant bunch, many key public officials are still hemming and hawing over the release of their statements of assets, liabilities and net worth.

SALN disclosure is mandated for accountability under the Constitution itself, with an enabling law passed way back in 1989 – Republic Act 6713, the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.

Over the weekend, Malacañang renewed its commitment to release the SALN of President Marcos and his Cabinet members – something that was routinely done annually until Samuel Martires was appointed as ombudsman by Rodrigo Duterte.

But the Palace commitment came with a warning that it would not allow public access to SALNs to be used for political attacks.

What this means exactly is unclear. Typically, journalists are the ones who request for the SALNs of public officials. Once reported in media, the information becomes public knowledge. If the information is used for unlawful purposes, there are laws governing such acts, and aggrieved parties can take legal action.

As for using the SALN for political attacks, what of it? Across the political spectrum, criticisms or “attacks” are par for the course. There is no provision in the Constitution or RA 6713 protecting SALNs from criticism. Transparency in the asset declaration is in fact meant to open the SALN to public scrutiny.

Some officials have echoed Martires’ belief that SALNs have been “weaponized.” This is the same reason invoked by the Supreme Court in spearheading the move to keep SALNs under lock and key.

But many things – from the law to a ballpoint pen – can be used as a weapon. If the fear of things being weaponized would prevail, the knife and the internet would never have been invented.

Since Ombudsman Jesus Crispin Remulla restored public access to SALNs, the number of public officials releasing their asset declarations continues to grow – with no consequences so far about the SALNs being used as a weapon against them.

Akbayan party-list congressmen led the way in early September. To date, among the others who have released their SALNs are Speaker Faustino Dy III and Senate President Vicente Sotto III.

The nation awaits similar moves from the President, the Vice President and the Chief Justice, followed by their underlings. No more excuses. It’s time to move beyond rhetoric on transparency and accountability.
