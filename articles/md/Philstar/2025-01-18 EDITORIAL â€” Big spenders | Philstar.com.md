It sounds like baying at the moon, although the sentiment is shared by other people. Former elections commissioner Luie Tito Guia is urging candidates to disclose the sources of their campaign funds, and for voters to seek transparency from those aspiring for elective office.

Candidates, win or lose, are in fact required under election laws to file a statement of their campaign contributions and expenditures. Guia, an electoral reform advocate, says the Commission on Elections has the capability, although limited, to verify such SOCEs.

A gray area, however, is campaigning before the official start of the campaign period. The Supreme Court, citing legislation, has ruled that campaign laws and regulations apply only during this official period. This effectively meant there is no such thing as premature campaigning even after certificates of candidacy have been filed, and even after the candidacy has become official through inclusion in the ballot.

And so, long before the official campaign period starts, the public is bombarded with patently political advertising on multimedia platforms as well as electric posts, trees, utility cables, walls and fences in places where the local government is unable or unwilling to crack down on littering, environmental violations and illegal posting of advertising materials. In such areas, the local government officials themselves are usually the biggest violators of the rules.

There are campaign spending limits set by the Comelec, and certain violators have been penalized in the past years. Before the official start of the campaign period, the Comelec may not have jurisdiction over patently political advertising. But anti-graft laws can be applied in the case of incumbent public officials who accept cash for their personal benefit, gifts or favors beyond what is allowed under Republic Act 6713, the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.

For candidates who are not in government, meanwhile, campaign donations are exempt from the donor’s tax under the Omnibus Election Code, but only if declared to the Comelec, and only if spent during the official campaign period. Outside this period, such contributions would be taxable.

Because of the virtually limitless period allowed for self-promotion by aspirants for public office, the cost of election campaigns in this country has become prohibitive. Guia says it is good to ask candidates why they are spending amounts way beyond their income earning capabilities to win elective office where the cumulative pay for the entire term will never match the campaign expenditures. What might be the return on a hefty investment, for both the candidate and the generous donors? And how will that ROI be obtained?

The answers to those questions can explain why politicians put themselves ahead of the national interest and the greater good.
