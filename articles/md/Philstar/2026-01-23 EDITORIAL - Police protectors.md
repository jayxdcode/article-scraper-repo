From the start, police involvement has been suspected in the kidnapping of 34 cockfighting aficionados between April 2021 to January 2022.

The sabungeros went missing reportedly following what probers said was their suspected involvement in rigging cockfights, in which police officers were among major losers. Several police officers have been indicted and arrested over the case.

Also from the start, suspicion on who was behind the kidnappings and suspected murders focused on only one person – gambling tycoon Charlie “Atong” Ang.

So it’s not farfetched to believe stories circulating that police officers, allegedly including four retired generals, are protecting Ang from arrest, which trial courts in Lipa City and Laguna ordered.

Knowing his ties with police, authorities should have kept close tabs on Ang from the time he was charged in court and faced the prospect of arrest for non-bailable offenses.

Now a manhunt is underway, with the Department of the Interior and Local Government dangling a P10-million reward for information leading to the arrest of “the most wanted person” in the country.

With his billions in gambling funds, Ang can easily match that amount, and increase it a hundred times to buy his continuing freedom. Authorities have said there is no record of Ang leaving the country. But neither was there any record of the departure of Alice Guo when she was the mayor on the run of Bamban, Tarlac, or of former presidential spokesman Harry Roque.

The Philippine National Police is reportedly pursuing reports that some of its officers are the ones protecting Ang. Those suspected should be subjected to an asset scrutiny or a lifestyle check. Anyone caught should face the full force of the law for aiding and abetting a wanted man.

Authorities must also check out reports that Ang could be behind a new online gambling operation. This would ensure continued capacity to use the police for personal purposes, from helping him hide and murdering those who get in his way.
