Filipino women have broken many glass ceilings and several laws have been passed to promote women’s welfare. The country has had two women presidents and the incumbent Vice President is the third woman to occupy the nation’s second highest post.

Women are active participants in Philippine politics and all levels of governance as well as socioeconomic, cultural and recreational activities. In many households, women are the main breadwinners.

Gender equality is one area where the Philippines ranks high in comparative international studies. As the nation joins the world in marking Women’s Day today, there are Filipino men who are repeating the joke that what they need is a Men’s Day.

In fact there’s still a wide room for improvement in promoting the welfare of women. Many corporate boardrooms and management positions in the country remain predominantly or all-male. So are the star-rank positions in the uniformed services, although this could change as more women choose this career path.

Despite the enactment of laws protecting women and girls from gender discrimination, harassment and various forms of abuses, enforcement leaves much to be desired.

While Filipino women with sufficient education and financial independence are aware of their rights under the law and are empowered to achieve their full potential, this is not the case for millions of others. The 2022 National Demographic and Health Survey conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority showed that 17.5 percent of Filipino women aged 15 to 49 had experienced physical, sexual and emotional violence at the hands of intimate partners.

The Philippine Commission on Women believes the cases are underreported due to a “culture of silence” among victims. Apart from shame in disclosing their experience, some victims also believe filing a complaint is useless in the country’s weak legal system.

Women typically juggle the demands of paid work or career with motherhood. The challenge is greater for women who find the need to leave their children behind to work overseas or in urban centers in the Philippines. Even Pope Francis, when he visited Manila, openly expressed concern over this social cost of worker migration.

Impoverished women also continue to be deprived of reproductive health care. The conditional cash transfer has eased this problem, but there are still many women who fall through the cracks.

Unemployment is higher for women at 8.2 percent compared to men at 7.5 percent. Women’s labor participation is at 51.2 percent compared to men at 75.4 percent, the Commission on Population and Development reported on the eve of Women’s Day. There is still much work ahead in promoting the welfare of Filipino women.
