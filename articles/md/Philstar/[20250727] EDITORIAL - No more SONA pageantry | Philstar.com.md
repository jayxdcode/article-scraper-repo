No more fashion show, no red carpet, no pageantry. Why this instruction still has to be given for the conduct of the joint opening of the 20th Congress this Monday says a lot about the state of the nation, which President Marcos will report on for the fourth time since he assumed power.

The country has Republic Act 6713, the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees, whose declaration of policy states, in accordance with the Constitution: “It is the policy of the State to promote a high standard of ethics in public service. Public officials and employees shall at all times be accountable to the people and shall discharge their duties with utmost responsibility, integrity, competence and loyalty, act with patriotism and justice, lead modest lives, and uphold public interest over personal interest.”

If the requirements alone for accountability, integrity and “modest lives” would be applied, it could warrant criminal indictments for a large number of officials in all three branches of government, including members of the two chambers of Congress.

In the previous 19th Congress, a scandal erupted over the display of a Hermes bag by a congresswoman who used to be an economics professor at the University of the Philippines.

Observers including some lawmakers themselves have pointed out that the joint opening session of Congress, highlighted by the State of the Nation Address of the president of the republic, is not a gala event involving a fashion show of pricey gowns and menswear, but a kickoff to the serious business of pursuing the legislative agenda for the year.

In announcing a toned-down joint session and SONA, lawmakers pointed out that many areas are still reeling from the extreme rainfall and heavy flooding from several storms and the monsoon. The disasters left at least 25 people dead with eight still missing as of Friday, and prompted the suspension of classes and government work in Metro Manila and several other parts of Luzon for the entire week.

This avowed sensitivity to the plight of the people must extend beyond the joint opening of Congress and the SONA, and even during fine weather. Adherence to the code of conduct and ethical standards must be an all-weather commitment of every public servant.
