For environmentalists, it’s noteworthy that the beloved Pope Francis passed away on Easter Monday, the eve of Earth Day, April 22. Throughout his papacy, Francis had championed climate action, emphasizing the importance of living in harmony with nature and protecting the planet.

With the theme “our power, our planet,” the 55th anniversary of the observance of Earth Day stresses the need for a global alliance to protect the environment, with a focus on renewable energy and climate action.

Since the first Earth Day was organized on April 22, 1970, global awareness of the importance of environmental protection has grown exponentially. The threats posed by climate change have also been acknowledged, with the international community moving for concerted action to confront global warming.

Going green, the blue economy and sustainable living have become household phrases. Recycling has become a way of life in many parts of the globe. And yet the challenges are so heavy and complicated that efforts remain inadequate to protect the Earth.

Conservation and sustainability efforts are uneven across the globe. Wildlife species are still endangered or becoming extinct because of the destruction of natural habitats. Disruption of wildlife has also led to the emergence of killer diseases, a number of which still have no cure.

Forests continue to be depleted in many places while coral networks are still being destroyed, with destructive fishing methods now aggravated by rising ocean temperatures. In the South China Sea and West Philippine Sea, China has destroyed the environment by building artificial islands on coral networks in its aggressive effort to stake an expansive maritime claim with no basis in international law.

Governments in developing states stress that even the shift to renewable energy must be balanced with the demands of industrialization and national development to reduce poverty. Developing and advanced economies cannot agree on which one must play a greater role in the shift.

Pope Francis’ passing means the loss of a powerful voice for climate action. Meanwhile, the second rise to power of Donald Trump threatens to roll back global progress in confronting climate change. With the United States under Trump taking the lead, climate action could be in reverse gear for the next four years.

With these challenges, Earth Day 2025 calls for greater commitment from both governments and the people to pursue climate action.
