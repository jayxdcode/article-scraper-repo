The latest word from Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla as of yesterday was that there would be no more jokes in announcements of class suspensions. At the height of torrential flooding in Metro Manila and neighboring areas this week, Remulla was the one who posted online announcements about the suspension of classes and government work.

For still unclear reasons, Remulla, according to reports, had asked for this task, which Department of Education Secretary Sonny Angara believes should be left to DepEd offices and local government units, since these agencies can assess local situations and act on weather advisories faster. Malacañang authorized Remulla to issue the announcements this week, although the DepEd and LGUs can still perform the same work for speedier disaster response and mitigation.

Announcing the suspension of classes and office work in a timely way is not as simple as it sounds, especially with climate change making extreme rainfall and sudden cataclysmic flooding a regular occurrence. People want to be told about class and work suspensions ideally before they wake up early to prepare for school or work, or at least before they have left their homes so they don’t end up trapped in floods or stuck for hours in traffic.

Remulla made the wait for such an announcement more complicated by posting silliness, using flippant slang words that younger generations cannot understand, before the message about the class and work suspensions.

The attempt at cuteness did not sit well with people worried about their homes and communities being inundated by monsoon rains and floods, and being unable to earn a living for the day. Remulla issued an apology, sort of, but said it’s the way he is, take it or leave it. President Marcos even came to his defense, saying that it was simply the way the secretary of the interior and local government communicated.

You can see why Malacañang seems to be burdened with a communication problem. Among those who await timely and clear announcements of class suspensions are educators and school administrators, who deserve respect especially from a member of the Cabinet.

Why a public official would think class suspensions are a joking matter gives you an idea why the country is facing an education crisis. Classes and office work are suspended due to natural disasters that can claim lives, devastate livelihoods, and destroy billions worth of infrastructure, crops and property. If the secretary of the interior thinks this is a joking matter, the government’s disaster response is in serious trouble.
