Here’s another reason why the flood control scandal is so infuriating: among the 193 member states of the United Nations, the Philippines has retained its rank as the most disaster-prone.

The WorldRiskIndex 2025 listed the Philippines as the state most prone to disasters arising from floods, storms, droughts and earthquakes. The risk is expected to worsen due to climate change and rapid urbanization, according to the report, which this year focuses on flood risks.

India ranked second to the Philippines in the index, followed by Indonesia, Colombia, Mexico, Myanmar, Mozambique, the Russian Federation, China, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

“The risk profile of the Philippines is characterized by a variety of natural hazards, with river and coastal flooding playing a particularly central role,” said the report, which is produced by Germany’s Institute for International Law of Peace and Armed Conflict and Bündnis Entwicklung Hilft or Alliance Development Works.

A flood exposure analysis identified Cagayan, Agusan del Norte, Pangasinan, Pampanga and Maguindanao as the most flood-prone provinces, with their flat terrain, wide river basins and inadequate drainage. At lowest risk is Marinduque followed by Laguna, Batanes, Sarangani and Dinagat Islands.

The report also cited “social inequality, structural vulnerability and weak health systems” as drivers of disaster risk. “These reduce adaptability and resilience,” the report said.

Risk adaptation strategies were suggested, including improvements in flood control and early warning systems using data-based solutions as well as nature-based measures such as reforestation, river restoration and unsealing.

Metro Manila ranked sixth in flooding risk in the index, followed by Camarines Sur, Misamis Oriental, Camarines Norte and Isabela.

Bulacan was not even in the top 10 provinces at highest risk. Yet billions in public funds were poured into flood control projects in the province, with probes indicating that practically all of them are substandard or even non-existent.

The flood control program is a national disaster. Corruption has worsened the country’s disaster risk, and must be addressed as resolutely as the other aspects of flooding.
