As of last Wednesday, the Commission on Elections said it had issued show-cause orders to six senatorial candidates and 34 party-list groups, requiring an explanation for their continued illegal posting of campaign materials.

While the Comelec has no control over the display of campaign materials on private property, it can regulate and impose penalties related to the posting of such materials in public spaces, as provided under the Fair Elections Act and two Comelec resolutions. Prohibited areas include public school premises, government office buildings, parks, footbridges, bridges, waiting sheds, electric posts, utility wires and trees. The Omnibus Election Code also provides rules governing campaigns.

The Comelec has reminded candidates and party-list groups that violation of election law is a criminal offense. Aside from perpetual disqualification from public office and the loss of the right to vote, those found guilty face imprisonment ranging from one to six years, fines of up to P10,000 or both penalties.

Such warnings, however, have been routinely issued in previous elections. Except on private property, the Comelec has not been emasculated by the courts in carrying out its mandate related to these issues. The Comelec’s failure to show that it can and will enforce laws and rules has made not only candidates but also the general public believe that such warnings are nothing more than a best-efforts pledge or, worse, a joke.

If anyone has been punished, the candidate must have been a minnow in an ocean of violators. Such cases are easily forgotten by the nation and written off as token enforcement of the law. Only the punishment of a big fish for election offenses will convince the nation that election laws in this country are meant to be followed.

Social media has helped highlight the extent of blatant violations of the laws and rules on fair campaigning. There is heightened public awareness – and disgust – over the brazenness of the violations.

The Comelec cannot afford to ignore that disgust. It has announced initial moves against the violators. It’s time for the Comelec to get serious about enforcing election laws. And no small fry, please.
