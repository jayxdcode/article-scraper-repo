In countries with a clean government, regularity is presumed in public services, with state auditors and systems of checks and balances working to discourage wrongdoing.

This presumption of regularity, unfortunately, has taken a back seat in our country as corruption is suspected in nearly all government projects and services. Instead of operating on the presumption of regularity, governance is now saddled with a widespread presumption of thievery.

Officials at all levels of government must now be subjected to close scrutiny, to ensure that dirty hands are kept off public coffers. Their lifestyles are watched for indications of ill-gotten wealth. Even their children are scrutinized for signs of living beyond their means.

In the Department of Public Works and Highways, Secretary Vince Dizon has issued orders to livestream bidding activities, require proper geotagging of project sites, and demand a sworn statement from project bidders on their beneficial ownership and family ties to DPWH and other government officials.

Members of the DPWH bidding and awards committee will have a fixed term of just one year, with their task likened by Dizon to “jury duty” as projects are stalled by the corruption scandal and the procurement process needs to be speeded up.

Dizon has also reduced the project amounts for procurement or bidding that DPWH regional and district engineers can handle at their level.

Installed in his latest post following the resignation of Manuel Bonoan, Dizon has found it necessary to reiterate to the DPWH rank and file the prohibition against the splitting of project contracts.

It remains to be seen if his directives will be followed, and how long compliance will be sustained in a department where corruption apparently has been the rule rather than the exception for a long time.

Can this tiger change its stripes? DPWH personnel can ditch their uniforms for now, but the rot will still be there.

Because of the picture that has emerged about the magnitude of the corruption, there are suggestions that the DPWH be abolished and a new department created. While the idea has some appeal, it is, of course, easier said than done, and Dizon has shot it down.

But the idea could gain traction if people outraged by corruption see little meaningful change in the DPWH.

There must be some good eggs in the putrid DPWH basket, and they can help in cleaning up their agency. The best way for them to save their jobs and their agency is to show that it is no longer business as usual in the DPWH.
