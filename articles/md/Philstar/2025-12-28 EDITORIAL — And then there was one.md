Except for private contractor Sarah Discaya, who has become – unfairly or not – the face of unbridled corruption in flood control, and her husband Curlee who is detained at the Senate, no big fish landed in jail for an unhappy Christmas in connection with the scandal.

Meanwhile, the roster of commissioners in the Independent Commission for Infrastructure will soon be reduced to one as top accountant Rossana Fajardo confirmed yesterday that she would be with the ICI only until Dec. 31.

“I have completed the work I set out to accomplish when I was appointed, ensuring that the foundational goals of the Commission have been met,” Fajardo said.

Her resignation came on the heels of Rogelio Singson’s departure from the ICI effective Dec. 16. Singson, a former secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways, said work pressures in the ICI had taken a toll on his body. He has been tapped as consultant in the DPWH as the housecleaning in the scandal-ridden agency continues.

Fajardo’s resignation leaves ICI chairman Andres Reyes Jr. all by his lonesome. With no replacements named by Malacañang for Singson and Fajardo and no new funding announced after the belated release of P41 million for ICI needs until year-end, it looks like Reyes’ task is mainly to wrap up the work of the commission.

Malacañang said Fajardo’s role “was always meant to be temporary” and she had completed the tasks she was asked to perform. Her findings will be part of the ICI’s recommendations to the Office of the Ombudsman and the Commission on Audit, among other agencies, Malacañang said.

Some lawmakers said the ICI is now in the ICU. There was no clarity in the first place on what President Marcos wanted the ICI to be or do exactly. It received funding only this month. It lacked the powers to subpoena or sanction people linked to the corruption scandal. But it was seen as a reflection of the avowed commitment of the Marcos administration to hold accountable those who have stolen up to a trillion pesos in people’s money meant for public infrastructure.

With only the chairman left among three commissioners, the Palace will have to reassure the public that even with the ICI winding down its work, the commitment of the administration to accountability in the flood control mess is sincere and will be pursued.
