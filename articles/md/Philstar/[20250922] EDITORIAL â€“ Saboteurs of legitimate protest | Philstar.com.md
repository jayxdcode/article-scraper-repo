The young men wore mostly black shirts and face masks. They carried no placards expressing their grievances, although some waved black Straw Hat Pirates flags. What they had with them were large rocks and Molotov cocktails, which they hurled at crowd control police at the entrance to Mendiola in an apparent attempt to proceed to Malacañang.

Someone set fire to a truck using a mini flamethrower. Others flashed the dirty finger for press cameras. Some who refused to take off their masks in TV interviews could not say what they were protesting against. Others said they were members of a fraternity, but would not say which one.

Police were seen retreating as the youths pelted them with rocks and overwhelmed the street barricades. But the police later pushed back with water cannons and apprehended several of the youths, a number of whom were half-naked. Most of the initial 19 who were caught were minors aged 15 to 17, according to Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla, who stressed that police still observed maximum tolerance.

While the Marcos administration supports mass protests to hold the government accountable, Remulla said instability, violence and anarchy cannot be tolerated.

Yesterday’s scenes of violence at Mendiola, which erupted after members of progressive groups had ended their protest and left the area, were reminiscent of the violent mass actions during the so-called EDSA III, staged in 2001 against the ouster of Joseph Estrada as president through people power.

This time, massive protests are again being staged, against large-scale corruption in flood control and other infrastructure projects. Organizers of the protests have said they are not calling for the ouster of President Marcos, which would mean his replacement by his constitutional successor, Vice President Sara Duterte. And among the subjects of public outrage is Estrada’s son Sen. Jinggoy Estrada.

Those youths in Mendiola yesterday were clad in what looked like uniforms, and showed up armed with rocks, improvised explosives and even flamethrowers. It didn’t look like a spontaneous gathering.

Authorities should determine if that was an organized action to sow violence and exploit public anger over large-scale corruption.

There are many more mass protests ahead. Saboteurs, people with a sinister personal agenda and young hoodlums suffering from arrested development must not be allowed to hijack legitimate expressions of public outrage.
