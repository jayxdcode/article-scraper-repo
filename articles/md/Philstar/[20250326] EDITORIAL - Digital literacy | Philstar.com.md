The proliferation of fake news and disinformation is deeply concerning, and the injection of politics into the issue is complicating efforts to address the problem. Studies have shown that many Filipinos canâ€™t tell fake from accurate news.

One way of addressing the problem without dragging politics into the response is through an intensified promotion of digital literacy. This can be incorporated into the regular curriculum beginning in grade school.

At what grade the subject will be introduced can be left to the jurisdiction of school administrators, since the capacity to understand the subject could depend on the availability of digital gadgets and connectivity. In this aspect, children from underserved communities are obviously at a disadvantage. Many of them may even be living in areas with no internet access.

In more developed communities, the typical child is a digital native. Many play with adult cell phones or tablets as soon as their fingers are strong and nimble enough to manipulate gadget screens or keyboards. In such communities, digital literacy can be introduced early in elementary school.

Digital literacy includes understanding the ways of mainstream media and journalism. Public trust underpins the viability of print and broadcast media, which adhere to journalistic ethics and have firewalls against the dissemination of fake news, disinformation and malicious commentary. Unlike posts on social media, news and commentary on mainstream media must go through layers of filters for accuracy and adherence to those ethics.

One problem in making digital literacy part of the regular curriculum is whether there are enough educators who can teach the subject. As part of its upskilling program, the Department of Education can get experts from various sectors to provide training to a core group of teachers, who can then cascade what they have learned to their peers across the country.

For adults especially in underprivileged communities, the government can also provide digital and media literacy sessions to go hand-in-hand with ayuda programs.

Getting accurate information is critical in many aspects of life, from health care to job hunting and making choices in elections. Promoting digital and media literacy must be treated with urgency by all stakeholders.
