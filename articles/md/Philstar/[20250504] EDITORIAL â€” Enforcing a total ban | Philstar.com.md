The 10-day total ban on the distribution of all forms of social amelioration ayuda programs, except emergency assistance such as those for medical and burial needs, is now in effect. Enforcing the election-related ban can best be carried out through citizen vigilance and cooperation.

Covered by the total ban are the controversial Ayuda para sa Kapos ang Kita Program or AKAP, Assistance for Individuals in Crisis Situations or AICS, Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged / Displaced Workers or TUPAD and related programs administered mostly by the Department of Social Welfare and Development.

DSWD officials have maintained that even outside election periods, department guidelines prohibit politicians from participating or identifying beneficiaries for state-funded social amelioration programs. Video footage and photos, however, show that the guidelines have been blatantly violated even by top government officials.

Also covered by the total ban, as stressed by the Commission on Elections, is the sale of heavily subsidized rice at P20 a kilo. This was launched on May 1 by the Department of Agriculture in the pilot area of Cebu despite accusations that it was merely a vote-getting stunt of the administration.

The Comelec found it necessary to impose the total ban in an effort to prevent the use of state resources for the self-promotion of candidates in the final stretch of the campaign for the midterm elections on May 12.

A limited ban preceded the total prohibition, with the Comelec warning violators of disqualification from the midterm races. All candidates, including incumbent local government executives and lawmakers running for elective office, were banned by the Comelec from participating in the distribution of ayuda programs or selection of beneficiaries, whether in person or through the display of campaign materials around venues.

Based on experience, Comelec officials say vote buying and the misuse of state resources for personal or partisan purposes spike in the final week of the official campaign period. So the Comelec decided to impose the total ban on ayuda distribution 10 days before election day.

As certain government officials have control over state resources for ayuda, however, citizen vigilance is needed to ensure compliance with the total ban. The Comelec has initiated probes motu proprio or on its own of candidates for possible violations of election rules. Citizens can do their part by monitoring and reporting violations, for appropriate action by the Comelec.

All forms of government ayuda are tax-funded. No politician has a license to take personal credit for it and misuse state resources.
