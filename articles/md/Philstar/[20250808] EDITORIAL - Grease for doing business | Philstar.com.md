A town mayor of Pampanga is now in detention following his arrest in a sting conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation in Angeles City on Aug. 5.

NBI officials said San Simon Mayor Abundio Punsalan Jr. and aide Ed Ryan Dimla were caught red-handed in receiving P30 million in marked bills from representatives of RealSteel Corp. Apart from the pair, NBI agents arrested six bodyguards of Punsalan who were in the restaurant where the payoff was made.

RealSteel had sought NBI help, claiming that Punsalan and Dimla were demanding P80 million for the release of the company’s business permit to operate in San Simon.

The only positive aspect of this story is that the accused extortionists have been caught in the act and are currently in NBI custody at its detention facility in Muntinlupa.

But the case highlights a problem brought up for some time now by the business community, which has driven away investments and dampened entrepreneurship: mountains of red tape, and the need for grease money to facilitate government services, particularly in the local government and barangay levels.

The country has laws against corruption and plunder. Two laws have also been passed to cut red tape and promote ease of doing business. Several administrations have ordered government agencies to speed up business processing, with Rodrigo Duterte setting specific days for completing various types of government transactions.

Yet here is a mayor, accused of demanding P80 million and caught accepting a whopping P30 million in marked money, as reported by the NBI.

President Marcos, in his numerous foreign trips, tells investors that the Philippines “is open for business.” If the investors who respond positively to his invitation do come here, they will be dismayed to find out that they need to grease palms before they can open for business. They will be doubly dismayed to learn that those demanding grease money are led by the mayor himself of the locality where they plan to do business.

Punsalan, who is on his third and final term as municipal mayor, has reportedly been suspended four times since taking office in 2019 over various issues. Probers should find out how he managed to keep bouncing back, while determining the extent of shakedowns at the San Simon town hall.
