# A prepared but impatient VP

#### Philippine Daily Inquirer / 05:35 AM December 02, 2025

All vice presidents operate under the expectation that they are ready at any time to shoulder the singular constitutional duty for which they were elected.

Yet rare is the vice president who will confess eagerness to fulfill that mandate, and to do so at a precarious time in the nation’s life when sinister plots to unseat the incumbent government are afoot. Then again, nobody can accuse Sara Duterte of being your regular Vice President. She is, as lawyer politicians like to say, sui generis — one of a kind.

“Of course. There is no question about my readiness,” the daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte said with typical bravado last week. “I ran for vice president … I know I am first in line for succession. There is no question on about what I will do.”

Indeed, there is no question about what Duterte can do to be president. But now it seems the better question is what she won’t do.

A day later, Palace press officer Claire Castro fired back at Duterte, characterizing her remarks as a “form of political destabilization.” “It is not acceptable for a vice president to anticipate the resignation of the President,” she said, adding that such talk “contributes to a climate of uncertainty and crisis.”

## A power grab

Under the 1987 Constitution, the vice president will assume the presidency “in case of death, permanent disability, removal from office, or resignation of the President.”

But the issue isn’t about Duterte correctly pointing out her role as the constitutional successor to President Marcos. The issue is that she is making a point of it during active efforts to destabilize the administration and adding fuel to the flame of public anger due to the widening corruption crisis.

This time, the whispers have grown too loud to dismiss as mere fodder for barbershop talk. On Nov. 23, Sen. Panfilo Lacson disclosed that retired military officers invited him to join a “civil-military junta” that would replace Mr. Marcos should their plans succeed. The senator said he rebuffed the overtures.

On Oct. 3, Armed Forces chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. confirmed failed attempts by retired and active officers to mount a coup d’etat for a “reset of the Philippine society” at the height of the Sept. 21 mobilization. Rumors had also swirled about the business community eyeing billionaire businessman Ramon Ang as a caretaker should a transition council materialize.

If true, all these illustrate the breadth of a fishing expedition that involves retired soldiers, politicians, tycoons, and anyone who might help legitimize a power grab.

## Iron fist not warranted

The mere fact that these proposals were made at all, and perhaps even entertained, makes for a combustible political atmosphere. Add to all that the recklessness of a Vice President who, instead of calming the waters, whips up the waves for her own purpose.

Duterte may insist that she is merely stating a constitutional fact, but public officials understand that context is everything. While the Vice President has denied any link to those agitating for withdrawal of support, even seemingly innocuous words will inflame tensions, fuel instability, and embolden those opportunists she considers her allies.

The President would be foolish to ignore all this talk as harmless chatter. While an iron fist is not warranted, he must quash these plots in decisive fashion. Everyone involved should be held accountable for dabbling in seditious proposals, especially those uniformed men who remain stuck in the bygone era where they could stage mutinies without consequence.

But make no mistake: Calling for the resignation of the President is not sedition; provoking others to try to overthrow the government is the precise definition of it. The authorities must not blur this distinction.

## Gravity of VP’s office

The President, too, must reassure the public that he is firmly in control of the situation. He must put out the fires of unrest with a clear repudiation of unconstitutional solutions, a directive to security agencies to name and charge the conspirators, and a call for sobriety from all political actors — including the overeager Vice President.

Vice presidents do not exist to rattle markets or deepen insecurity. They exist so that, should the moment come, the country does not plunge into chaos. Duterte’s remarks, however, raise doubts about her judgment and understanding of the gravity of her office.

The nation does not need more noise when retired generals are knocking on senators’ doors, business magnates are being floated as caretakers, and ordinary folk are gathering in the streets, all while the government is cracking down on the plunderers within its ranks.

In this volatile environment, Duterte’s job is not only to be ready for succession but to convince the public that she would not resort to unlawful means to rise to power. Because being prepared to be president is not all it takes to be a good vice president; one also needs prudence and above all, patience.
