# Skewed sense of entitlement

Hardly have “nepo babies” faded from social media posts, when a video of another form of toxic entitlement went viral over the weekend: a Lexus with blinkers on and protocol plate No. 10 had apparently been involved in a road rage incident, which showed the car’s driver slapping the driver of the multicab for allegedly getting in the way of the “VIP” he was transporting. As one of the SUV’s passengers was heard saying: “VIP kami, ginanon kami. Eh kung nabaril namin ‘yan? Delikado ‘yang ginagawa mo, pare!”

That VIP turned out to be Department of Transportation (DOTr) Undersecretary for Special Concerns Ricky Alfonso who has yet to explain to his bosses, Acting DOTr Secretary Giovanni Lopez and Land Transportation Office Assistant Secretary Markus Lacanilao, why he was using the protocol plate meant exclusively for judges of the Court of Appeals and the Sandiganbayan.

Alfonso has since gone on leave, his driver terminated, and investigation into the incident ongoing, said Lopez who also ordered the revocation of protocol license plates issued to officials of the DOTr and its attached agencies.

The restricted use of protocol plates is in accordance with Executive Order No. 56 issued by President Marcos, who authorized it only for top level officials, from the president to senators, House representatives, judges of the Supreme Court, the Sandiganbayan, Court of Appeals and Tax Appeals, the military and police chiefs, and so on. While Cabinet secretaries are included in the list, nowhere was there mention of undersecretaries.

## Edsa busway

The President’s Administrative Order No. 18 meanwhile prohibited officials from using sirens, blinkers, and similar devices in their motor vehicles.

The incident involving Alfonso recalls similar instances of traffic violations among government officials over the use of the Edsa busway exclusively meant for public buses, ambulances, and marked government vehicles responding to emergencies.

Among those who flaunted their privilege were relatives and staff of two sitting senators, a woman who name-dropped a general, and a movie star turned politician who called out authorities for letting people like him stew in traffic, while the carousel lane had room enough for more than buses.

That Alfonso, a DOTr official—who presumably knows traffic rules—would wantonly violate them shows the skewed sense of entitlement among government officials who hold themselves above the law. The incidents raise questions about the accountability of “VIP” personnel who abuse the perks and privileges of their position. Shouldn’t they hold themselves up as role models to taxpayers who pay their salaries?

## Level the playing field

By stripping officials of such VIP-style privileges, Lopez showed how political will can level the playing field to ensure that traffic rules apply equally to all drivers.

Lopez had earlier required senior officials of the DOTr to commute to work at least once a week, starting Sept. 17, 2025. The mandate was meant to ensure that officials would have firsthand experience on the challenges and predicament faced by commuters that would hopefully help them craft more responsive transportation policies. Is this directive still in place? Can the agency post the weekly reports required of its officials that would include proof of their commute, like tickets or time-stamped photos?

In his notice to explain to Alfonso, Lopez emphasized that government officials are constitutionally duty-bound to “be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, and act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives.”

Exactly. While the Lexus was found to not be Alfonso’s personal property, what was he doing tooling around in a luxury vehicle whose blinkers were meant to part traffic so he could pass through smoothly instead of enduring the traffic woes of the rest of us mere mortals?

## Collective disgust

If former DOTr chief Vince Dizon could order the agency to automatically suspend the license of erring motorists for 90 days, shouldn’t Lopez put DOTr officials to a higher standard?

As Lacanilao vowed, the agency is committed to enforcing all laws and regulations “without fear or favor, regardless of position or title.” For a start, the agency can make an example of Alfonso to show it means business. He has betrayed the public trust, and shouldn’t that merit more than just indefinite suspension?

With people’s collective disgust over corruption spilling over, officials shedding their entitlements could at least appease a public already chomping at the bit over the long-drawn out investigations and conviction of the guilty behind the flood control mess.

Malacañang should start the process of imposing accountability, and revoke all special license plates, except for top officials including judges. Revoking such a privilege should make public officials identify with the sufferings of the common people whom they profess to serve.
