# Naia’s makeover

The positive feedback on the ongoing transformation at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) terminals brings good tidings. It couldn’t have come at a more auspicious time—no less than the busy holiday season—when our airports become places of stress-fueled meltdowns brought on by disorganized long queues, lost luggage, or delayed or cancelled flights, among others.

No major mayhem has been reported, despite over 675,000 passengers—6.59 percent higher than the number recorded last year—passing through Naia during the Christmas travel rush from Dec. 20 to 23.

Who can forget the power outage on Jan. 1, 2023, that brought down the air navigation system and paralyzed the Philippine airspace for about eight hours, affecting 361 flights, and leaving more than 70,000 passengers stranded? And then, another power outage in May and June of the same year?

For years, travelers have ranked Naia in global surveys as one of the worst airports in the world. From bed bugs, rats, to delayed flights, not to mention its immigration and ground personnel being in the news for corruption and other shenanigans—it has made the wrong impression, especially on visitors coming to the Philippines for the first time.

## High expectations

Filipinos themselves have not been spared from the various inconveniences (e.g., poorly maintained toilets, taxi scams) and embarrassment (e.g., “tanim-bala” extortion scandal, “pastillas” issue) of travelling through Naia.

That’s why news that airport operations were turned over to the San Miguel Corporation-led New NAIA Infrastructure Corporation (NNIC) in September last year was welcomed and met with high expectations that, finally, the much-needed rehabilitation would boost the country’s main international gateway and remove it from the worst airport ignominious list.

Among the immediate upgrades that NNIC implemented since the takeover were the repair of toilets, escalators, and air-conditioning systems, and the installation of a dedicated substation to ensure a stable power supply and no more repeats of the 2023 New Year’s Day chaos. Terminal 4, which was planned for renovation, has been demolished due to safety concerns, and a new terminal is instead being constructed near Terminals 1 and 2, and is expected to open in the middle of next year.

NNIC also reported that it freed up about 1,800 parking slots and widened arrival curbsides to address traffic bottlenecks outside the terminals. It has also set up automated parking systems that reduce waiting times and allow drivers to make autopay or e-wallet payments.

## Transport connectivity

These rehabilitation works have not been spared, though, from complaints such as higher terminal and parking fees, as well as rental fees for concessionaires. Party list representatives have even called for an investigation into these issues, pointing out that public services should not be turned into a cash cow by private businesses. They warned that other public services, such as the water utilities, should serve as a precautionary tale on how not to handle public-private partnerships.

These complaints should not be dismissed but instead taken as important feedback. There is no doubt that NNIC has already achieved a lot, yet there is still so much to be done, like improving transport connectivity from the airport.

Earlier this month, President Marcos himself inaugurated a new lounge reserved for official engagements and modern food halls that offer wider options—all located in Terminal 3. “It looks like a real airport, finally,” Mr. Marcos quipped.

More importantly, the President unveiled 78 biometric e-gates, which are expected to ensure a smoother travel experience for passengers. The e-gates will be rolled out in phases, with machines already operational at Terminals 1 and 3 for international flights.

## World-class experience

Photos of the machines have gone viral with many Filipinos touting on social media how Naia is already leveling up with its international counterparts.

The use of these e-gates is expected to substantially reduce the immigration process from 45 seconds for manual processing to as fast as eight seconds per individual. What is seen as an even bigger advantage is how this system could “remove opportunities for corruption,” as Bureau of Immigration spokesperson Dana Sandoval put it. “Of course, you cannot pay a machine to be able to sneak past immigration. That’s why we see this as a very important tool,” she said.

Her statement also drives home a very important and crucial part of the airport’s makeover. All these improvements will be wasted if the syndicates that have allegedly operated in Naia’s labyrinths for decades and destroyed the airport’s reputation continue to exist. Personnel reforms must accompany the cosmetic upgrades and modern technology. Only then can traveling through Naia become a truly pleasant, stress-free, and world-class experience.
