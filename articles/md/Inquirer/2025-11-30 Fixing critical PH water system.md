# Fixing critical PH water system

Water is one of the most important natural resources: it is essential for human life and sustains the food we eat, among others.

But, per a new report, the Philippines’ water supply is being threatened by climate change. Extreme weather patterns are not only bringing stronger typhoons or longer droughts that imperil Filipino lives and property, but it is also putting at risk the Philippines’ water resources.

The report, “Climate Landscape Analysis for Children in the Philippines” by Unicef Philippines and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources launched this week, also warned that 40 to 80 percent of the country’s water supply could be depleted by 2040 due to climate-related impacts.

It said the most vulnerable are children and communities in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, as well as in rural, indigenous and geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas.

“Damaged infrastructure and contaminated water sources increase the risk of waterborne diseases. With less than half of the population with access to safe drinking water in 2024, climate change is further eroding progress toward universal access,” the report stated.

## Critical vulnerability

Robert Borje, vice chair and executive director of the Climate Change Commission, also pointed out that “water insecurity remains a critical vulnerability” in the Philippines, with only 48 percent of the population having access to safely managed potable water. “As global temperatures rise, this scarcity is expected to intensify,” he said.

In another report, nonprofit media organization Climate Tracker Asia said the agriculture sector is just as vulnerable and this could impact the country’s food security.

“Rising demand for water—driven by population growth and climate change—is projected to exceed current levels by 2050, particularly in cities, heightening the likelihood of conflicts between agricultural and urban users,” it further noted.

In these future scenarios where water supply is seen to shrink amid a rising population growth, experts see a heightening competition between urban and rural users.

However, even urban areas that are supposed to have better access and quality are also under strain due to poor infrastructure and industrial pressures. News headlines about poor water quality or service interruptions and shortage have been common and blamed on poor governance or underinvestment by private water concessionaires.

## Fragmented water governance

These problems especially worsen during the dry season where some areas have to resort to water rationing—something that happened a lot in the 1990s and early 2000s but what no one would expect in today’s today’s highly advanced world.

Last year, President Marcos said about 11 million families lacked access to clean water, a figure that was almost half of the total 26.39 million families in 2020 based on government data.

Lawmakers such as FPJ Panday Bayanihan Rep. Brian Poe have been calling for reforms, including a sweeping overhaul of the country’s fragmented water governance system. “More than 30 agencies currently handle water, sanitation, flood control, and regulation,” Poe said just the other day. “The result is predictable: repeated water crises, poor coordination, and wasted public funds.”

Poe has authored House Bill No. 1189, which also seeks to establish a dedicated Department of Water Resources (DWR), of which several bills have been pending in Congress.

Last February, Mr. Marcos himself directed various agencies to thresh out the issues related to the creation of the DWR that is envisioned to cut inefficiencies in the delivery of water service, strengthen regulation, and ensure clean, reliable supply for Filipino households.

## Growing threat

In the previous Congress, the House of Representatives already passed a bill seeking to create DWR but counterpart measures have languished at the Senate. With the growing threat of water scarcity, the President must renew his call for Congress to pass water-accessibility measures. He must also certify these bills as urgent.

However, the government need not wait for Congress to pass a law. One of the more immediate actions it can take is to heed experts’ advice to expand water storage systems through dams and reservoirs.

Another step, as Mr. Marcos himself pointed out, was to lessen reliance on underground aquifers and improve filtration systems to better manage surface water and make potable water more accessible.

The billions in flood control projects that were lost to corruption could have funded these much-needed infrastructure to ensure accessibility to safe and clean water for more Filipinos and prevent water-related illnesses.

The government must work together toward a comprehensive solution that aligns water policies with public health, climate adaptation, agricultural production, and resources management.

This is the only way to fix the country’s broken water system.
